abstract = {Our study addresses the role of non-genetic and genetic inheritance in shaping the adaptive potential of populations under a warming ocean scenario. We used a combined experimental approach [transgenerational plasticity (TGP) and quantitative genetics] to partition the relative contribution of maternal vs. paternal (additive genetic) effects to offspring body size (a key component of fitness), and investigated a potential physiological mechanism (mitochondrial respiration capacities) underlying whole-organism growth/size responses. In very early stages of growth (up to 30 days), offspring body size of marine sticklebacks benefited from maternal TGP: offspring of mothers acclimated to 17 °C were larger when reared at 17 °C, and offspring of mothers acclimated to 21 °C were larger when reared at 21 °C. The benefits of maternal TGP on body size were stronger and persisted longer (up to 60 days) for offspring reared in the warmer (21 °C) environment, suggesting that maternal effects will be highly relevant for climate change scenarios in this system. Mitochondrial respiration capacities measured on mature offspring (F1 adults) matched the pattern of TGP for juvenile body size, providing an intuitive mechanistic basis for the maternal acclimation persisting into adulthood. Size differences between temperatures seen at early growth stages remained in the F1 adults, linking offspring body size to maternal inheritance of mitochondria. Lower maternal variance components in the warmer environment were mostly driven by mothers acclimated to ambient (colder) conditions, further supporting our tenet that maternal effects were stronger at elevated temperature. Importantly, all parent-offspring temperature combination groups showed genotype × environment (G × E) interactions, suggesting that reaction norms have the potential to evolve. To summarize, TGP and G × E interactions work in concert to mediate impacts of ocean warming on metabolic capacity and early growth of marine sticklebacks. TGP can buffer short-term detrimental effects of climate warming and may buy time for genetic adaptation to catch up, therefore markedly contributing to the evolutionary potential and persistence of populations under climate change.},

abstract = {Ecological features of Lake Myvatn and the outflowing River Lax{\'{a}} show a wide range of spatial and temporal variations. The physical division of the lake into three main basins and the variation in chemical composition and temperature of the artesian springs feeding this shallow productive lake have large spatial effects. Variation in groundwater characteristics depends on percolation time and proximity to geothermal sources. Variation in precipitation is evened out by the porous volcanic soil and bedrock and the spring-water discharge is therefore very stable. A pulse of volcanic activity in 19751984 (the Krafla Fires) heated the groundwater entering the North Basin of the lake and changed its chemistry. Although much reduced, these effects have not disappeared yet, but overall the impact of the volcanic activity on the biota seemed minimal. Recycling of nutrients through internal loading is important and occurs on various time scales. In winter, when the lake is ice-covered, the topmost 5-cm layer of sediment pore water has a hundredfold concentration of nutrients relative to the overlying lake water. The nutrients are released during the ice-free period by sediment resuspension, diffusion, bioturbation and recycling. In spring, resuspension events sometimes lead to spikes in dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen, but there is little evidence of any major desorption of nutrients from suspended particles during such events later in the summer. In contrast to the stable groundwater, the biota show more or less regular fluctuations with no straightforward correlation with external signals. The most prominent fluctuations, those of the chironomid Tanytarsus gracilentus seem to be driven by interactions between the species and its sediment resources. Fluctuations in other invertebrates could be a consequence of the Tanytarsus cycles due to the large impact this species has on the benthic environment of this detritus-driven ecosystem. Temporal variation in epibenthic chironomids and Cladocera translates into variable production of vertebrate predators (Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, and ducks), body condition and mortality of fish and sometimes into return rates of migrating adult ducks. The waterfowl show large temporal variation on a centennial scale, e.g., the invasion of the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) which arrived by the end of the 19th century and has by now outnumbered other species. Fluctuations of Cyanobacteria (Anabaena) and the fish Gasterosteus aculeatus (three-spined stickleback) harmonize with the cycles in the benthic community. Palaeolimnological studies indicate that primary production in the South Basin became increasingly benthic as the lake depth was reduced by sedimentation (around 2 mm year -1). Other trends include a decrease in Tanytarsus and Daphnia and an exponential increase in green algae (Cladophorales, Pediastrum) and associated organisms.},

Of fundamental importance is how the environment influences individual phenotypic development while simultaneously selecting among phenotypic variants in a population. Conceptual and theoretical treatments of the evolutionary implications of plasticity are numerous, as are criticisms of the conclusions. As such, the time is ripe for empirical evidence to catch up with theoretical predictions. To this end, I provide a summary of eight hypotheses at the core of this issue, highlighting various approaches by which they can be tested. My goal is to provide practical guidance to those seeking to understand the complex ways by which phenotypic plasticity can influence evolutionary innovation and diversification. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {The vertebrate skeleton is a plastic organ system and the skeleton of teleosts is no exception. Epigenetic factors during development influence skeletal anatomy, mechanical properties, and meristic characters. The adult teleost skeleton undergoes changes connected to mechanical adaptation, repair, mineral homeostasis, sexual maturation, and aging. Vestiges, rudiments, atavisms, hyperostotic bones, additional tooth rows, and variable numbers of vertebral bodies are prominent examples of variable characters. Morphological changes require changes of skeletal structures on the cellular level, including modulation, transdifferentiation, and remodelling. Alterations at the cellular level are best understood by acknowledging those characters that distinguish teleost skeletons from mammalian skeletons: (a) the absence of osteocytes in most species of teleosts; (b) abundant mononucleated osteoclasts that perform non-lacunar bone resorption; (c) a phosphorous-rather than a calcium-driven mineral homeostasis; and (d) a variety of tissue types intermediate between bone and cartilage. This brief account of teleost skeletal plasticity shows that the teleost skeleton is a lifelong plastic organ system. Using examples, also from our own studies, we provide examples of skeletal plasticity at various hierarchical levels.},

abstract = {Fish body shape is affected by the genetic makeup of an individual as well as environmental influences, such as diet, development, growth rate and nutrition. Fishes in the family Cichlidae exhibit tremendous morphological diversity in body shape and morphology related to feeding. Certain aspects of cichlid feeding morphology have been shown to be plastic in response to different diets but plasticity in body shape has not been examined previously. Plasticity affects ecological interactions, the direction and rate of evolution, and has ramifications for characters used in systematic studies. I examined the effect of different diets: chironomid larvae (bloodworms) and brine shrimp nauplii, on body shape in two species of the Neotropical cichlid genus Geophagus which differ in the size at which young begin feeding on external food sources. The fry of G. brasiliensis, a substrate spawner, begin to feed on external food sources earlier than the fry of G. steindachneri, a mouthbrooder. I hypothesized that the difference in size at first feeding could lead to a difference in the amount of plasticity inducible in the two species. The magnitudes of changes were mostly similar, although G. brasiliensis responded to the different diets with slightly greater changes in some of the head measurements. The pattern of changes in the two species were also similar, with fish fed ferine shrimp nauplii developing longer and shallower heads and shallower bodies and tails than fish fed chironomid larvae. I also examined the consequences of considering family and age as additional factors besides diet in G. steindachneri. Considering family or age as additional factors in the analyses did not change the conclusion that different diets induce differences, albeit small ones, in body shape. I argue that morphological plasticity is dependent on behavioural flexibility and that it may enhance evolutionary morphological diversification. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {The role of phenotypic plasticity in the acclimation and adaptive potential of an organism to global change is not currently accounted for in prediction models. The high plasticity of marine fishes is mainly attributed to their early stages, during which morphological, structural and behavioural functions are particularly sensitive to environmental constraints. This developmental plasticity can determine later physiological performances and fitness, and may further affect population dynamics and ecosystem functioning. This review asks the essential question of what role early stages play in the ability of fish to later cope with the effects of global change, considering three key environmental factors (temperature, hypoxia and acidification). After having identified the carry-over effects of early exposure reported in the literature, we propose areas that we believe warrant the most urgent attention for further research to better understand the role of developmental plasticity in the responses of marine organisms to global change.},

For many traits, much of this variation is caused by phenotypic plasticity, and thus the impact of plasticity on species coexistence deserves robust quantification. Partly due to a lack of sound theoretical expectations, empirical studies make contradictory claims regarding plasticity effects on coexistence. Our critical review of this literature, framed in modern coexistence theory, reveals that plasticity affects species interactions in ways that could impact stabilizing niche differences and competitive asymmetries. However, almost no study integrates these measures to quantify the net effect of plasticity on species coexistence. To address this challenge, we outline novel empirical approaches grounded in modern theory.},

abstract = {Questions: Do evolutionary changes in phenotypic plasticity occur after anthropogenic disturbance? Do these changes tend to be increases or decreases in plasticity? How do these evolutionary patterns differ among taxa and trait types? Does evolution of plasticity change with time since the disturbance? Data incorporated: Evolutionary rates for plasticity estimated from 20 studies that have compared a plastic response in two or more populations, at least one of which had experienced an anthropogenic disturbance in nature and at least one of which had not. Method of analysis: We estimate evolutionary rates (darwins and haldanes) for plasticity for each study, which represent the amount of evolutionary change in plasticity. We then perform analyses of covariance, with the evolutionary rate numerator (amount of evolutionary change) as a response variable, taxa and trait type as predictor variables, and the amount of evolutionary time as a covariate. Conclusions: We find that plasticity has evolved in several cases, including both increases and decreases in the levels of plasticity following anthropogenic disturbances. The typical direction of this evolutionary response depends on an interaction between taxon and trait type. For instance, invertebrates sometimes show the evolution of increased plasticity for life-history traits, but the evolution of decreased plasticity for morphological traits. Plants, on the other hand, show no trends in the direction of plasticity evolution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Erika Crispo.},

abstract = {Evolutionary community ecology is an emerging field of study that includes evolutionary principles such as individual trait variation and plasticity of traits to provide a more mechanistic insight as to how species diversity is maintained and community processes are shaped across time and space. In this review we explore phenotypic plasticity in functional traits and its consequences at the community level. We argue that resource requirement and resource uptake are plastic traits that can alter fundamental and realised niches of species in the community if environmental conditions change. We conceptually add to niche models by including phenotypic plasticity in traits involved in resource allocation under stress. Two qualitative predictions that we derive are: (1) plasticity in resource requirement induced by availability of resources enlarges the fundamental niche of species and causes a reduction of vacant niches for other species and (2) plasticity in the proportional resource uptake results in expansion of the realized niche, causing a reduction in the possibility for coexistence with other species. We illustrate these predictions with data on the competitive impact of invasive species. Furthermore, we review the quickly increasing number of empirical studies on evolutionary community ecology and demonstrate the impact of phenotypic plasticity on community composition. Among others, we give examples that show that differences in the level of phenotypic plasticity can disrupt species interactions when environmental conditions change, due to effects on realized niches. Finally, we indicate several promising directions for future phenotypic plasticity research in a community context. We need an integrative, trait-based approach that has its roots in community and evolutionary ecology in order to face fast changing environmental conditions such as global warming and urbanization that pose ecological as well as evolutionary challenges. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

abstract = {Almost all animal species are engaged in predator-prey interactions. These interactions, variable in time and space, favor the emergence and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which allows prey to fine-tune their phenotype to the current risk of predation. A famous example is the induction of defensive neck-teeth, spines or helmets in some water fleas when they detect cues of predator presence. In general, the response may involve different types of traits (behavioral, morphological, physiological, and life-history traits), alone or in combination. The induced traits may be adaptive anti-predator defenses or reflect more general stress-based responses. Recently, it has been found that predator-induced plasticity occurs not only within but also across generations (transgenerational plasticity), i.e., the phenotype of a generation is influenced by the detection of predator-cues in previous generation(s), even if the current generation is not itself exposed to these cues. In this paper, we aim to review this accumulating literature and propose a current state of key aspects of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity in metazoans. In particular, we review whether patterns of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity depend on the type of traits. We analyze the adaptive value of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity and explore the evidence for its evolution and underlying mechanisms. We also consider its temporal dynamics: what are the time windows during which predator-cues must be detected to be transmitted across generations? Are transgenerational responses in offspring stage-dependent? How many generations does transgenerational plasticity persist? Finally, we discuss other factors highlighted in the literature that influence predator-induced transgenerational plasticity: what are the relative contributions of maternal and paternal exposure to predator-cues in generating transgenerational plasticity? Do transgenerational responses depend on offspring sex? Do they scale with the perceived level of predation risk? This review shows that we are only at the beginning of understanding the processes of predator-induced transgenerational plasticity, and it encourages future research to fill the lack of knowledge highlighted here.},

abstract = {Dynamics of biological invasions may be complicated in size-structured animal populations. Differences in timing of life history events such as juvenile emergence create complex interaction webs where different life stages of native and non-native species act as predators, competitors, and prey. Stream salmonids are an ideal group for studying these phenomena because they display competition and predation in size-structured populations and have been introduced worldwide. For example, introduced rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are invading streams of Hokkaido Island, Japan and have caused declines in native masu salmon (O. masou) populations. However, age-0 rainbow trout emerge later than age-0 masu salmon and are smaller, which raises the question of why they are able to recruit and therefore invade in the face of a larger competitor. We conducted experiments in laboratory stream channels to test effects of increasing density of age-0 and age-1 rainbow trout on age-0 masu salmon. Age-1 rainbow trout dominated age-0 masu salmon by aggressive interference, relegating them to less favorable foraging positions downstream and reducing their foraging frequency and growth. The age-1 trout also reduced masu salmon survival by predation of about 40% of the individuals overall. In contrast, age-0 rainbow trout had little effect on age-0 masu salmon. Instead, the salmon dominated the age-0 trout by interference competition and reduced their survival by predation of 60% of the individuals. In each case, biotic interactions by the larger species on the smaller were strongly negative due to a combination of interspecific competition and intraguild predation. We predict that together these produce a positive indirect effect in the interaction chain that will allow the recruitment of rainbow trout in the face of competition and predation from age-0 masu salmon, and thereby facilitate their invasion in northern Japan.},

abstract = {Ontogenetic niche shifts, changes in the diet or habitats of organisms during their ontogeny, are widespread among various animal taxa. Ontogenetic niche shifts introduce stage structure in a population with different stages interacting with different communities and can substantially affect their dynamics. In this article, I use mathematical models to test the hypothesis that adaptive plasticity in the timing of ontogenetic niche shifts has a stabilizing effect on consumer-resource dynamics. Adaptive plasticity allows consumers in one ontogenetic niche to perform an early shift to the next ontogenetic niche if the resource density of the first niche is low. The early shift will reduce predation by the consumer on the scarce resource. On the other hand, adaptive plasticity allows consumers to delay their shift to the next niche if the resource density of the first niche is high. The delayed shift will increase the predation on the abundant resource. As a result, the scarce resource will tend to increase, and the abundant resource will tend to decrease. This causes density-dependent negative feedback in the resource dynamics, which stabilizes the consumer-resource dynamics. To test this hypothesis, I compare three consumer-resource models differing in terms of mechanisms controlling the timing of the ontogenetic niche shift: the fixed-age model assumes that the age at which the ontogenetic niche shift occurs is fixed; the fixed-size model assumes that the size at the shift is fixed; and the adaptive plasticity model assumes that the timing of the shift is such that the individual fitness of the consumer is maximized. I show that only the adaptive plasticity model has a locally stable equilibrium and that the stabilizing effect is due to the density-dependent negative feedback in the resource dynamics. I discuss the ontogenetic niche shifts of lake fish in light of the obtained result.},

abstract = {Fish constitute the most species-rich group of the vertebrates. They have adapted to highly diverse habitats in the sea and fresh waters of the world and display great phenotypic variability. Some fish groups have gone through extremely rapid local radiations with clear connections to ecological factors. Such extensive radiations are, for example, seen in various groups of cichlids in the African rift lakes (e.g., Echelle and Kornfield 1984; Meyer 1993; van Alphen et al. in Chapter 8). Radiations in those vast lakes have been termed intralacustrine, which emphasizes that the relevant speciation events in the monophyletic species flocks are not necessarily sympatric (Smith and Todd 1984; Meyer 1993). A convincing case for sympatric speciation is seen in studies of cichlids in Cameroon crater lakes (Schliewen et al. 1994). In many cases, the evolution of diversity is seen to occur within populations of what are still considered single species, in which so-called varieties or morphs have emerged as a result of adapting to different habitats and food resources (e.g., Robinson and Wilson 1994; Sk{\'{u}}lason and Smith 1995; Smith and Sk{\'{u}}lason 1996). From a purely ecological perspective, these phenomena can be viewed as resource polymorphisms (Sk{\'{u}}lason and Smith 1995). From an evolutionary perspective, they can be seen as multiple instances of incipient speciation. Thus, resource polymorphisms provide important opportunities to study the role of ecological factors in the evolution of new species (Schluter 1996b, 1998, 2001).},

Major research directions in the years to come include understanding the transition from extrinsic environment-dependent to intrinsic reproductive isolation and its influences on species persistence and understanding the extrinsic and intrinsic constraints to speciation and how these relate to broad-scale diversification patterns through time.},

abstract = {Much thinking in evo-devo is dominated by a mindset that views traits and trait variants as emergent properties of genes and genomes, and environments as strictly external to and separable from the organisms that develop within them. Growing evidence accumulating across diverse fields is increasingly questioning the continued usefulness of this framework, resulting in calls for a more explicit recognition and integration of the interdependencies between development, envi-ronment, and phenotypic evolution. In the first section of this chapter, we review the ubiquitous and diverse roles that environmental conditions play in instructing developmental outcomes, as well as how failure to provide proper environmental signals can disrupt development or lead to the expression of novel phenotypic variants. In the second section, we discuss how the environmental conditions that organisms experience are often modified by the organisms themselves, how these interactions can reciprocally shape development, and how their study is best advanced within the context of niche construction theory. In the final section, we address how the integration of niche construction theory with five research programs central to evo-devo (i.e., evolutionary innovation and diversification, developmental bias, developmental plasticity, genetic accommodation, and inclu-sive inheritance) can lead to a more holistic and complete understanding of development and developmental evolution.},

abstract = {There is growing interest in the delineation of feeding patterns in animals, but little is known about the interaction of multiple explanatory factors across broad geographical scales. The goal of this study was to identify the factors that together determine population-level patterns in piscivory in a globally distributed aquatic predator, the brown trout (Salmo trutta). A meta-analysis of peer-reviewed studies revealed that the prevalence (frequency of occurrence, %) of piscivory increases from riverine to marine ecosystems, with fish community type and the size-structure (ontogeny) of brown trout populations being the key drivers. Thus, piscivory was related to ecosystem-specific differences in predator body size (increasing in populations with large individuals) and fish community configurations (increasing with fish species richness). Fish species richness imposes important limitations on (i.e. in low diversity scenarios) or facilitate (i.e. in high diversity scenarios) piscivory in brown trout populations, with a low prevalence expected in low-diversity fish communities. In fresh water, piscivory is higher in lentic than lotic ecosystems and, in the former, increases with latitude. Competition in multi-species systems is expected to be higher than in simpler systems because the size-structure and species composition of fish assemblages, explaining cross-ecosystem differences in piscivory.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity is a major mechanism of response to global change. However, current plastic responses will only remain adaptive under future conditions if informative environmental cues are still available. We briefly summarize current knowledge of the evolutionary origin and mechanistic underpinnings of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, before highlighting the potentially complex effects of global change on cue availability and reliability. We then illustrate some of these aspects with a case study, comparing plasticity of blue tit breeding phenology in two contrasted habitats: evergreen and deciduous forests. Using long-term datasets, we investigate the climatic factors linked to the breeding phenology of the birds and their main food source. Blue tits occupying different habitats differ extensively in the cues affecting laying date plasticity, as well as in the reliability of these cues as predictors of the putative driver of selective pressure, the date of caterpillar peak. The temporal trend for earlier laying date, detected only in the evergreen populations, is explained by increased temperature during their cue windows. Our results highlight the importance of integrating ecological mechanisms shaping variation in plasticity if we are to understand how global change will affect plasticity and its consequences for population biology.},

abstract = {How populations and species respond to modified environmental conditions is critical to their persistence both now and into the future, particularly given the increasing pace of environmental change. The process of adaptation to novel environmental conditions can occur via two mechanisms: (1) the expression of phenotypic plasticity (the ability of one genotype to express varying phenotypes when exposed to different environmental conditions), and (2) evolution via selection for particular phenotypes, resulting in the modification of genetic variation in the population. Plasticity, because it acts at the level of the individual, is often hailed as a rapid-response mechanism that will enable organisms to adapt and survive in our rapidly changing world. But plasticity can also retard adaptation by shifting the distribution of phenotypes in the population, shielding it from natural selection. In addition to which, not all plastic responses are adaptive—now well-documented in cases of ecological traps. In this theme issue, we aim to present a considered view of plasticity and the role it could play in facilitating or hindering adaption to environmental change. This introduction provides a re-examination of our current understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in adaptation and sets the theme issue's contributions in their broader context. Four key themes emerge: the need to measure plasticity across both space and time; the importance of the past in predicting the future; the importance of the link between plasticity and sexual selection; and the need to understand more about the nature of selection on plasticity itself. We conclude by advocating the need for cross-disciplinary collaborations to settle the question of whether plasticity will promote or retard species' rates of adaptation to ever-more stressful environmental conditions.},

abstract = {The adaptive capacity of individuals, from their cells to their overall performance, allows species to adjust to environmental change. We assess a hierarchy of responses (from cells to organismal growth and behaviour) to understand the flexibility of adaptive responses to future ocean conditions (warming and acidification) in two species of fish with short lifespans by conducting a long-term mesocosm/aquarium experiment. Fishes were exposed to elevated CO2 and temperature in a factorial design for a five-month period. We found a feedback mechanism between cellular defence and behavioural responses. In circumstances where their antioxidant defence mechanism was activated (i.e. warming or acidification), increased feeding rates prevented oxidative damage (i.e. during warming Sp. 1). However, when feeding rates failed to increase to provide additional energy needed for antioxidant defence, oxidative damage could not be prevented (warming + acidification Sp. 1). In contrast, when the activation of antioxidant defence was not required, energy intake from increased feeding was redirected to increased fish growth (acidification Sp. 2, warming + acidification Sp. 2), whilst no gain in growth rate was observed where feeding remained unchanged (acidification Sp. 1 or warming Sp. 2). This adaptive strategy seems to rely on the inherent behavioural response of fishes to their environment and such adjustability shows the kind of responses that organisms may express to prevail in future ocean climate. Indeed, assessing the link between responses from cellular to organismal levels, using a diversity of fitness indicators and behaviour, provides a fundamental understanding of how organisms as a whole may adjust to prevail in a future world.},

abstract = {The phenotypic diversity exhibited within and among populations of freshwater fishes in postglacial lakes has intrigued biologists for two reasons: (i) their high phenotypic variation and (ii) the apparently recent and rapid divergence of forms. Genetic and ecological studies of these taxa are shedding new light on mechanisms of divergence and species formation. Surprisingly, the roles of phenotypic plasticity in the origins, maintenance, and generation of phenotypic diversity in this system are rarely directly addressed. We synthesize the available literature on morphological plasticity in these fishes and, using a meta-analysis, test for adaptive plasticity. We conclude that (i) morphological plasticity is common in at least six families of northern freshwater fishes, (ii) plastic responses can often be induced by conditions related to littoral and pelagic lake environments, (iii) plasticity often represents adaptive responses to conditions in these habitats, and (iv) that although rarely tested, heritable variation in morphological plasticity is present. The rich amount of phenotypic plasticity has not constrained recent adaptive divergence and species formation in postglacial fishes, and instead plasticity may play a role in the notably high rates of divergence observed in these and other fishes currently undergoing adaptive radiation.},

abstract = {Brown trout, Salmo trutta, is a polymorphic species that exhibits different migratory behaviors in different streams. Some populations contain juveniles that eventually migrate to the sea. In others, downstream movements are infrequent and individuals tend to spend their whole lives in freshwater. The term "partial migration" is used to describe the phenomenon by which a population is divided into resident and anadromous individuals. In rivers located in coastal areas with access to the sea, anadromous trout and resident trout usually live together and anadromous individuals return to home rivers to spawn. Adult migrants and residents can mate successfully and parr can grow together, indistinguishable until the time of smoltification. Migrants reach maturity after a period of growth in the sea, while the residents mature in fresh water, often at a smaller size. The decision between anadromy and residency in fresh water is an example of phenotypic plasticity and it is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with migration occurring when a threshold of genetic and environmental conditions is exceeded. This chapter reviews the most relevant publications on the early life stages of the brown trout, including studies and experiments in genetics, ecology and zoology. We pay special attention to all the freshwater phases of the trout life cycle (since the eggs are fertilized in the nest, until the anadromous parr migrate to the sea) in order to investigate those genetic and environmental factors related with sea migration. {\textcopyright} 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The advantage conferred by the spines depends upon relative size of predator to prey and likely has no effect upon predation by larger pike. Preferential selection of with individuals whose pelvic spines were removed, rather than without individuals (i.e. morphologically similar prey), suggests withouts compensate behaviourally for their morphological disadvantage. Analysis of food of large wild pike indicated that these postulated behavioural differences contributed to selective predation of individuals of the with phenotype in Wakomao Lake, Alberta, Canada. The frequency of these phenotypes in any situation represents a balance between counterselective forces, some of which are due to predation. Additional predatory species present in the lake and additional uses of pelvic spines probably also influence the phenotypic frequencies.},

Length-frequency analysis showed that the population in October consisted almost entirely of young-of-the-year. The per capita annual rate of increase was inversely related to abundance in October. Time series analysis suggested the presence of a cycle of abundance with a period of about 6 years. There was a significant inverse relationship between abundance in year t and in year t + 3. A simple, empirical, deterministic model based on this inverse relationship and run for 100 years predicted that population abundance showed damped oscillations leading to a stable abundance. When a stochastic component was added to the model, seven of 10 runs included a component with a period of about 6 years. These simulations suggest that the dynamics of this population are driven by an interaction between a deterministic (density-dependent) component and a stochastic component. We compare these results with time series of abundance of threespine stickleback obtained from the Thames Estuary in south-east England and Loch Lomond in Scotland. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

abstract = {The ability of populations to adapt to environmental change and the spatial scale at which this adaptation occurs are fundamentally important issues in evolutionary biology, and ones that may benefit greatly from the study of genetic variability in reaction norms, which represent the plasticity of phenotypic traits across an environmental gradient. Therefore variable reaction norms can reflect genetic differences in the ability of individuals, families, populations, and species to respond to natural and anthropogenic environmental change. Fishes are ideal organisms in which to study plasticity because of their remarkable intraspecific morphological, physiological, behavioural, and life history variation. Here, we review studies demonstrating genetic variability in reaction norms in fishes. Genetic variability in plasticity among full-and half-sib families suggests potential for some populations to develop an adaptive norm of reaction (recalling that plasticity need not be adaptive). Reaction norm variability among populations suggests that adaptive genetic divergence can occur rapidly when selection pressures are strong and that the spatial scale of adaptation is much smaller than previously believed for some species with high dispersal capabilities. These studies demonstrate the potential of using reaction norms to study the evolution of novel phenotypes and the influence of temporal environmental variability and gene flow on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, which can then be used to predict how populations will respond to directional environmental change. To promote future research into genetic variability in reaction norms, we propose questions that would benefit from such an approach and discuss some important considerations for designing experiments to investigate questions related to genetic variation in plasticity and phenotypic evolution.},

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary responses of natural populations to spatial environmental variation strongly depend on the relative strength of environmental differences/natural selection and dispersal/gene flow. In absence of geographic barriers, as often is the case in lake ecosystems, gene flow is expected to constrain adaptive divergence between environments - favoring phenotypic plasticity or high trait variability. However, if divergent natural selection is sufficiently strong, adaptive divergence can occur in face of gene flow. The extent of divergence is most often studied between two contrasting environments, whereas potential for multimodal divergence is little explored. We investigated phenotypic (body size, defensive structures, and feeding morphology) and genetic (microsatellites) structure in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across five habitat types and two basins (North and South) within the geologically young and highly heterogeneous Lake Myvatn, North East Iceland. We found that (1) North basin stickleback were, on average, larger and had relatively longer spines than South basin stickleback, whereas (2) feeding morphology (gill raker number and gill raker gap width) differed among three of five habitat types, and (3) there was only subtle genetic differentiation across the lake. Overall, our results indicate predator and prey mediated phenotypic divergence across multiple habitats in the lake, in face of gene flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Complex dynamics are often shown by simple ecological models and have been clearly demonstrated in laboratory and natural systems. Yet many classes of theoretically possible dynamics are still poorly documented in nature. Here we study long-term time-series data of a midge, Tanytarsus gracilentus (Diptera: Chironomidae), in Lake Myvatn, Iceland. The midge undergoes density fluctuations of almost six orders of magnitude. Rather than regular cycles, however, these fluctuations have irregular periods of 4-7 years, indicating complex dynamics. We fit three consumer-resource models capable of qualitatively distinct dynamics to the data. Of these, the best-fitting model shows alternative dynamical states in the absence of environmental variability; depending on the initial midge densities, the model shows either fluctuations around a fixed point or high-amplitude cycles. This explains the observed complex population dynamics: high-amplitude but irregular fluctuations occur because stochastic variability causes the dynamics to switch between domains of attraction to the alternative states. In the model, the amplitude of fluctuations depends strongly on minute resource subsidies into the midge habitat. These resource subsidies may be sensitive to human-caused changes in the hydrology of the lake, with human impacts such as dredging leading to higher-amplitude fluctuations. Tanytarsus gracilentus is a key component of the Myvatn ecosystem, representing two-thirds of the secondary productivity of the lake and providing vital food resources to fish and to breeding bird populations. Therefore the high-amplitude, irregular fluctuations in midge densities generated by alternative dynamical states dominate much of the ecology of the lake. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Two morphological forms of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus) coexist in Enos Lake near Nanoose Bay, Vancouver Island. For convenience, the two forms are referred to as "benthics" and "limnetics." Morphological and biochemical characteristics of the two forms were examined and artificial hybrids (F, and F,) reared in the laboratory. The two forms differ in male nuptial colour, body shape, and gill raker architecture. These differences are inherited and have remained stable for several generations. Benthics and limnetics also differ in allele frequencies at three loci (Mdh-3, Ck, and Pgm). At one of these loci (Mdh-3) the limnetic form is polymorphic and the benthic form is fixed. Since the two forms maintain themselves as discrete entities and there is no evidence of gene flow, they are considered separate biological species. It is not certain that either of these species is Gasterosteus aculeatus. Similar species pairs exist in other lakes in the Strait of Georgia region but, at present, their relationship to the species pair in Enos Lake is unknown.},

abstract = {Predators often show strong plasticity of optimal foraging strategies. A major difference in foraging strategies occurs between sit-and-wait and active predators. Models predict that the efficiency of these strategies is affected by environmental conditions, active predators being favoured when prey are scarce and their detection difficult. The shift between the two strategies may occur through both phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae of the fire salamander, Salamandra salamandra, are typically stream-dwelling sit-and-wait predators, but some populations breed in caves. We evaluated whether local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity determine shifts in foraging strategy between stream and cave populations. The foraging behaviour of salamander larvae was evaluated under all combinations of three test conditions during trials: light versus darkness, prey presence versus absence and food deprived versus fed; larvae originated from caves and streams and were reared in epigeous photoperiod or in darkness. Observations and video tracking showed that salamander larvae modified their behaviour in response to environmental conditions. In the darkness, larvae showed higher average velocity and moved longer distances. Movements were higher in food-deprived larvae and in the presence of prey compared to fed larvae and prey absent conditions. Furthermore, larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity than stream larvae, and better exploited the available space in test environments. Variation in foraging behaviour was strong, and involved complex interactions between plasticity and local adaptations. Larvae from cave populations showed higher behavioural plasticity, supporting the hypothesis that this trait may be important for the exploitation of novel environments, such as caves. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {The feeding performance of two morphs of a trophically polymorphic fish, the arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, feeding on zooplankton, was studied in the laboratory. Limnetic morphs, with a fusiform body, terminal mouth, short pectoral fins, and relatively long and dense gill rakers, fed at significantly higher rates on Daphnia and Cyclops than did benthic morphs. The benthic morphs were characterized by a chunky body form, subterminal mouth, long pectoral fins, and relatively short and spaced-out gill rakers. The limnetic morphs attacked the prey at significantly higher rates and were more successful in capture. Benthic morphs were more reluctant to start feeding on zooplankton and reaction time was longer than in limnetic morphs. In the absence as well as presence of zooplankton food, the position of the two morphs in the aquaria differed markedly. The results agree with dietary differences found in field-collected fish. The limnetic morphs consume zooplankton, whereas benthic morphs specialize on Lymnaea gastropods. The results suggest that benthic morphs are phenotypically inferior at using the pelagic food niche. This implies that the current role of competitive or predatory interactions in segregating the morphs may be minor. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Plasticity-first evolution (PFE) posits that novel features arise when selection refines pre-existing phenotypic plasticity into an adaptive phenotype. However, PFE is controversial because few tests have been conducted in natural populations. Here we present evidence that PFE fostered the origin of an evolutionary novelty that allowed certain amphibians to invade a new niche—a distinctive carnivore morph. We compared morphology, gene expression and growth of three species of spadefoot toad tadpoles when reared on alternative diets: Scaphiopus holbrookii, which (like most frogs) never produce carnivores; Spea multiplicata, which sometimes produce carnivores, but only through diet-induced plasticity; and Spea bombifrons, which often produce carnivores regardless of diet. Consistent with PFE, we found diet-induced plasticity—in morphology and gene expression—in Sc. holbrookii, adaptive refinement of this plasticity in Sp. multiplicata, and further refinement of the carnivore phenotype in Sp. bombifrons. Generally, phenotypic plasticity might play a significant, if underappreciated, role in evolutionary innovation.},

Trout more often successfully preyed upon individuals with pelvic reduction, which supports the hypothesis that robust pelvic girdles are maintained in stickleback populations because of selection by fish predators. Stickleback with complete pelvic girdles experienced a higher incidence of wounds from unsuccessful predation attempts, although this finding was not statistically significant, possibly because of low frequencies of wounded individuals. Spines likely facilitate postcapture defence, although stickleback with spines may also be less targeted by trout.

The results clearly showed that both fish species detected the predator by chemical signals alone but the combined chemical and visual signals caused stronger and more diverse reactions. Subsequent to predator detection, their swimming activity decreased, they attacked zooplankton less frequently and spent more time in the vegetation. Fishes differed in their anti-predator responses. Pike reacted more clearly to chemical signals alone while three-spined stickleback needed both chemical and visual cues to assess the predation risk. The strongest reaction was the reduction in swimming activity in the three-spined stickleback (38% decrease) and a decrease in attack rate of the pike (39% decrease), but only when a refuge was available. Pike were more dependent on the vegetation cover showing almost no anti-predator responses in the absence of a refuge.

abstract = {Predation pressure during early life stages is often high, but few studies have examined antipredator responses at these stages. We studied the effects of an egg predator (leech, Haemopis sanguisuga) and two tadpole predators (dragonfly larvae, Aeshna spp.; and three-spine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus) on the timing of hatching and morphology of hatchlings and young tadpoles in two anuran amphibians [Rana arvalis (RA) and R. temporaria (RT)] in a factorial laboratory experiment. We also compared the responses of two geographically separated RA populations on the Baltic island of Gotland and in Uppland on the Swedish mainland. We found inconsistent evidence for the predictions that the presence of an egg predator induces earlier hatching, and the presence of a larval predator delays hatching. RT hatched later in the presence of stickleback than in the control treatment, but RA hatched earlier, less developed and at smaller size in the leech, dragonfly, and stickleback treatments. There was no indication of predator-induced morphology in hatchlings of either of the species. However, young RA tadpoles had shorter tails and deeper bodies in the stickleback treatment and RT had shorter tails in the leech, dragonfly and stickleback treatments. Irrespective of treatment, RA from Gotland hatched with relatively longer bodies than Uppland individuals and had relatively deeper and short tails as young tadpoles. Our results highlight the diversity of induced responses to predators in anuran amphibians: predator presence affects the timing of hatching and morphology of young tadpoles, but these responses vary depending on the species and predator considered.},

abstract = {Climate change, biological invasions, and anthropogenic disturbance pose a threat to the biodiversity and function of Arctic freshwater ecosystems. Understanding potential changes in fish species distribution and richness is necessary, given the great importance of fish to the function of freshwater ecosystems and as a resource to humans. However, information gaps limit large-scale studies and our ability to determine patterns and trends in space and time. This study takes the first step in determining circumpolar patterns of fish species richness and composition, which provides a baseline to improve both monitoring and conservation of Arctic freshwater biodiversity. Information on species presence/absence was gathered from the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program's Freshwater Database and used to examine patterns of freshwater fish $\gamma$-, $\alpha$-, and $\beta$-diversity across 234° of longitude in the Arctic. The metrics of diversity provided information on species richness and composition across hydrobasins, ecoregions, and Arctic zones. Circumpolar patterns of fish species biodiversity varied with latitude, isolation, and coarse ecoregion characteristics; patterns were consistent with historic and contemporary barriers to colonisation and environmental characteristics. Gamma-diversity was lower in the high Arctic compared to lower latitude zones, but $\alpha$-diversity did not decrease with increasing latitude below 71°N, reflecting glacial history. Alpha-diversity was reduced to a single species, Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus, in ecoregions above 71°N, where $\gamma$-diversity was the lowest. Beta-diversity indicated little variation in the composition and richness of species across the High Arctic; at lower latitudes, ecoregions contained more species, although species composition turned over across large spatial extents. In an analysis of five ecoregions in the circumpolar Arctic, physical isolation, and ecoregion area and topography were identified as strong drivers of $\gamma$-, $\alpha$-, and $\beta$-diversity. Physical isolation reduced the $\gamma$- and $\alpha$-diversity, and changes in $\beta$-diversity between adjacent locations were due mainly to losses in species richness, rather than due to differences in species composition. Heterogeneity of habitats, environmental gradients, and geographic distance probably contributed to patterns of fish dissimilarity within and across ecoregions. This study presents the first analysis of large-scale patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity in the circumpolar Arctic. However, information gaps in space, time, and among taxonomic groups remain. Future inclusion of extensive archive and new data will allow future studies to test for changes and drivers of the observed patterns of biodiversity. This is important given the potential impacts of ongoing and accelerating climate change, land use, and biotic exchange on Arctic fish biodiversity.},

abstract = {To effectively respond to predation risk, prey must assess the risk associated with different predation cues. Predation cues can stem either from the predator or from conspecifics and indicate different predation risk levels, thus eliciting different anti-predation responses. The three-spined stickleback is a well-studied fish species often found in gregarious formations. Previous studies show that sticklebacks perform a variety of anti-predation behaviours; however, little is known about how they respond to multiple simultaneous predator cues, characteristic of heterogeneous natural habitats. Here, we experimentally compare the relative importance of three types of predation cues (visual predator cue, chemical predator odour cue and chemical alarm cue from injured conspecifics) and their interactions, on anti-predation and foraging behaviour of sticklebacks. Results showed that (1) individual sticklebacks responded most strongly to visual predator cues, which resulted in reduced foraging activity, increased spine erection and increased predator inspection; (2) the presence of chemical cues (predator odour and/or conspecific alarm cues) stimulates freezing behaviour to a minor extent; and (3) anti-predation behaviour manifests as a trade-off with foraging-related activities. Overall, the results indicate that sticklebacks could assess risk and modify their behavioural responses depending on which cues are present in the environment. The experimental approach of using factorial combinations of different predatory cues can increase our understanding of the role of multimodal cues in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {The salmonid arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) is one of the most widespread fishes in the world and is found farther north than any other freshwater or diadromous fish, but also in cool water farther south. It shows a strong phenotypic, ecological, and life history diversity throughout its circumpolar range. One particular side of this diversity is the frequent occurrence of two or more distinct charr morphs in the same lake. This polymorphism has been termed ‘the charr problem'. Similar cases are found in other postglacial fishes, but not with the extent and diversity as with the arctic charr. This review first treats the classical case, pioneered in an advanced way by Winifred Frost, of autumn and winter spawning charr in Windermere, England, and three other cases that have received much research interest in recent years: Thingvallavatn, Iceland; Loch Rannoch, Scotland; and Fjellfr{\o}svatn, Norway. Then a special kind of sympatry with one morph living permanently in the profundal zone, known from a few lakes in Europe, Russia and Canada and unique for arctic charr among postglacial fishes, is reviewed. Among them is a recently discovered charr at 450 m depth in Tinnsj{\o}en, Norway, one of the few very deep lakes in the world. With examples, the concluding discussion focuses on the variation of arctic charr polymorphisms which extends from early stages of ecological segregation to cases of reproductive isolation and speciation; and on models to explain the charr problem. The exceptional diversity of arctic charr provides a unique potential for further progress in studies on ecologically driven evolution within the frames of modern theory of developmental plasticity, adaptive radiation and adaptive speciation.

abstract = {The outcome of species interactions is often strongly influenced by variation in the functional traits of the individuals participating. A rather large body of work demonstrates that inducible morphological plasticity in predators and prey can both influence and be influenced by species interaction strength, with important consequences for individual fitness. Much of the past research in this area has focused on the ecological and evolutionary significance of trait plasticity by studying single predator-prey pairs and testing the performance of individuals having induced and noninduced phenotypes. This research has thus been critical in improving our understanding of the adaptive value of trait plasticity and its widespread occurrence across species and community types. More recently, researchers have expanded this foundation by examining how the complexity of organismal design and community-level properties can shape plasticity in functional traits. In addition, researchers have begun to merge evolutionary and ecological perspectives by linking trait plasticity to community dynamics, with particular attention on trait-mediated indirect interactions. Here, we review recent studies on inducible morphological plasticity in predators and their prey with an emphasis on internal and external constraints and how the nature of predator-prey interactions influences the expression of inducible phenotypes. In particular, we focus on multiple-trait plasticity, flexibility and modification of inducible plasticity, and reciprocal plasticity between predator and prey. Based on our arguments on these issues, we propose future research directions that should better integrate evolutionary and population studies and thus improve our understanding of the role of phenotypic plasticity in predator-prey population and community dynamics. {\textcopyright} The Society of Population Ecology and Springer 2009.},

I quantified between-individual variation in these behaviours as well as behavioural changes over time in two groups of sticklebacks that were either exposed or not exposed to simulated predation pressure. Shoaling and risk taking were repeatable within individuals in both experimental and control fish. Individual willingness to shoal increased over time in both experimental and control groups, but there was no evidence that shoaling changed in response to predation risk. Risk taking also showed temporal changes: sticklebacks exposed to simulated predation risk became increasingly fearful, unlike the control fish, suggesting that this behaviour is plastic. There was, however, no evidence of between-individual variation in the behavioural changes over time in either the control or experimental condition, suggesting that behavioural plasticity is a fixed response in the individuals of this population.},

abstract = {The food resource partitioning of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) and three‐spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) were investigated in the littoral zone of lake Takvatn in northern Norway in the ice‐free period June–November. Charr and sticklebacks had different feeding habits. Sticklebacks ate several small benthic prey items that were never eaten by charr, and the sticklebacks' diet were dominated by the benthic microcrustaceans Chydoridae and Ostracoda, chironomid larvae and stickleback eggs. Small charr (<17 cm) consumed a wide spectrum of chironomid pupae, terrestrial insects and zooplankton. Intermediate (17–20 cm) and small charr had quite similar feeding habits, while large charr (>20 cm) frequently ate both benthos, pelagic and terrestrial food. The diet overlap between small charr and sticklebacks was never larger than 0.6 (Schoener's index). The segregation in feeding habits indicates that small charr and sticklebacks are segregated in microhabitat when they are both in the littoral zone. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

@article{Denver2010,
abstract = {Developmental plasticity is the property of a given genotype to produce different phenotypes in response to the environmental conditions experienced during development. Chordates have two basic modes of development, direct and indirect. Direct development (mode of humans) was derived evolutionarily from indirect development (mode of many amphibians), the major difference being the presence of a larval stage with indirect development; larvae undergo metamorphosis to the juvenile adult. In amphibians, environmental conditions experienced during the larval stage can lead to extreme plasticity in behaviour, morphology and the timing of metamorphosis and can cause variation in adult phenotypic expression (carry-over effects, or developmental programming). Hormones of the neuroendocrine stress axis play pivotal roles in mediating environmental effects on animal development. Stress hormones, produced in response to a deteriorating larval habitat, accelerate amphibian metamorphosis; in mammals, stress hormones hasten the onset of parturition and play an important role in pre-term birth caused by intra-uterine stress. While stress hormones can promote survival in a deteriorating larval or intra-uterine habitat, costs may be incurred, such as reduced growth and size at metamorphosis or birth. Furthermore, exposure to elevated stress hormones during the tadpole or foetal stage can cause permanent neurological changes, leading to altered physiology and behaviour later in life. The actions of stress hormones in animal development are evolutionarily conserved, and therefore amphibians can serve as important model organisms for research on the mechanisms of developmental plasticity. {\textcopyright} 2010, Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.

abstract = {Intraguild predation is thought to be ubiquitous in natural food webs. Yet, theory on intraguild predation predicts the intraguild prey to persist only under limited conditions. This gap between theory and empirical observations needs scrutiny. One reason might be that theory has focused on equilibrium dynamics and a limited set of species (usually three) that interact in well-mixed populations in unstructured habitats, and these assumptions will often not hold in natural systems. In this review, we focus on the effects of habitat structure on intraguild predation. Habitat structure could reduce encounter rates between predators and prey and could create refuges for prey. In both cases, habitat structure could reduce the strength of intraguild interactions, thereby facilitating species coexistence. A meta-analysis of studies on manipulation of habitat structure shows that intraguild prey indeed suffer less from intraguild predation in structured habitats. This was further confirmed by a meta-analysis in which studies on intraguild predation were classified according to habitat structure. Intraguild predation reduced densities of the intraguild prey significantly more in habitats with little structure than in habitats rich in structure. The effect of intraguild predation on the shared prey was negative, and not significantly affected by habitat structure. We conclude that habitat structure may increase persistence of the intraguild prey by decreasing the strength of the interaction between intraguild predator and intraguild prey. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Intraguild predation-competition and predation by the same antagonist-is widespread, but its evolutionary consequences are unknown. Intraguild prey may evolve antipredator defenses, superior competitive ability on shared resources, or the ability to use an alternative resource, any of which may alter the structure of the food web. We tested for evolutionary responses by threespine stickleback to a benthic intraguild predator, prickly sculpin. We used a comparative morphometric analysis to show that stickleback sympatric with sculpin are more armored and have more limnetic-like body shapes than allopatric stickleback. To test the ecological implications of this shift, we conducted a mesocosm experiment that varied sculpin presence and stickleback population of origin (from one sympatric and one allopatric lake). Predation by sculpin greatly increased the mortality of allopatric stickleback. In contrast, sculpin presence did not affect the mortality of sympatric stickleback, although they did have lower growth rates suggesting increased nonpredatory effects of sculpin. Consistent with their morphology, sympatric stickleback included more pelagic prey in their diets, leading to depletion of zooplankton in the mesocosms. These findings suggest that intraguild prey evolution has altered food web structure by reducing both predation by the intraguild predator and diet overlap between species. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).

We reared first-generation offspring of two sympatric morphs of Arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus in the laboratory and compared their head morphology with that of their wild parents. Morphological characters with a known functional role in foraging were highly plastic. Rearing environment accounted for the largest component of the variation in expressed phenotype, but this environmental effect overlaid a clear (but small) genetic effect. We conclude that phenotypic plasticity has played a significant role in the evolution of this trophic polymorphism, but that the evolutionary process has progressed to the point that the gene pool is now segregated. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {Benthic Cladocera were monitored at five sites in Lake Myvatn, Iceland, over a decade (19901999), as part of a programme documenting the population fluctuations of animals at different trophic levels in the lake. The species composition remained relatively stable over the first seven years, but in 1997 the population of Eurycercus lamellatus was greatly reduced at all sites. The following year saw a mass occurrence of Alona rectangula and Alonella nana that were previously abundant only locally and rare at most sites. Alona affinis, A. quadrangularis, Acroperus harpae and Chydorus sphaericus were not affected. In 1999 the Cladocera assemblages returned to the pre-1997 situation. The shift was from large-bodied epibenthic and planktonic species (Eurycercus, Daphnia) to small infaunal (Alona rectangula) and ubiquitous (Alonella nana) species. Medium sized (Alona, Acroperus) and some small cladocerans (Chydorus) were not affected. The course of events was reminiscent of a trophic cascade caused by a change in size-selective predation pressure. If so, the impact of a predatory fish population (three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus) depended on whether cyclic chironomid populations were in a high or a low phase. The change in the Cladocera coincided with profound changes in the sediment characteristics associated with low chironomid abundance. We suggest that the relative competitive ability of the Cladocera species is reversed when the sediment has become homogeneous and nutrient-poor after overexploitation by the dominant, tube building and detritivorous chironomid Tanytarsus gracilentus.},

abstract = {Hormones are chemical signaling molecules that regulate patterns of cellular physiology and gene expression underlying phenotypic traits. Hormone-signaling pathways respond to an organism's external environment to mediate developmental stage-specific malleability in phenotypes, so that environmental variation experienced at different stages of development has distinct effects on an organism's phenotype. Studies of hormone-signaling are therefore playing a central role in efforts to understand how plastic phenotypic responses to environmental variation are generated during development. But, how do adaptive, hormonally mediated phenotypes evolve if the individual signaling components (hormones, conversion enzymes, membrane transporters, and receptors) that comprise any hormone-signaling pathway show expressional flexibility in response to environmental variation? What relevance do these components hold as molecular targets for selection to couple or decouple correlated hormonally mediated traits? This article explores how studying the endocrine underpinnings of phenotypic plasticity in an ecologically relevant context can provide insights into these, and other, crucial questions into the role of phenotypic plasticity in evolution, including how plasticity itself evolves. These issues are discussed in the light of investigations into how thyroid hormones mediate morphological plasticity in Death Valley's clade of pupfishes (Cyprinodon spp.). Findings from this work with pupfish illustrate that the study of hormone-signaling from an ecological perspective can reveal how phenotypic plasticity contributes to the generation of phenotypic novelty, as well as how physiological mechanisms developmentally link an organism's phenotype to its environmental experiences.},

abstract = {Many species of frogs and salamanders, in at least 12 families, alter their timing of hatching in response to conditions affecting mortality of eggs or larvae. Some terrestrially laid or stranded embryos wait to hatch until they are submerged in water. Some embryos laid above water accelerate hatching if the eggs are dehydrating; others hatch early if flooded. Embryos can hatch early in response to predators and pathogens of eggs or delay hatching in response to predators of larvae; some species do both. The phylogenetic pattern of environmentally cued hatching suggests that similar responses have evolved convergently in multiple amphibian lineages. The use of similar cues, including hypoxia and physical disturbance, in multiple contexts suggests potential shared mechanisms underlying the capacity of embryos to respond to environmental conditions. Shifts in the timing of hatching often have clear benefits, but we know less about the trade-offs that favor plasticity, the mechanisms that enable it, and its evolutionary history. Some potentially important types of cued hatching, such as those involving embryo-parent interactions, are relatively unexplored. I discuss promising directions for research and the opportunities that the hatching of amphibians offers for integrative studies of the mechanisms, ecology and evolution of a critical transition between life-history stages. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

abstract = {Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), commonly exhibits two coexisting morphotypes, dwarf and normal charr, which are characterized by differences in adult body size and colouration. We tested whether or not the morphotypic differences were genetically determined in rearing experiments with offspring of the two morphs and of their crosses. The experiments suggest that this ecological polymorphism in Arctic charr is largely environmentally determined. When reared under similar conditions, offspring of each of the two morphs differed little in size at the same age, and they had the same early developmental rate and maturation pattern. Moreover, the presence of parr marks along the flanks of the fish, one characteristic of dwarf charr, depended on body size and not on parental morph. Genetic differences between the morphs were suggested for growth rate during the second year of life, and for jaw morphology. Comparisons between charr life histories in captivity and in the wild suggest that ecological polymorphism in Arctic charr is chiefly a result of variation in growth conditions between different habitats.

abstract = {Competition for shared resources is typically invoked as the most important ecological interaction promoting diversification and speciation, whereas the roles of abiotic variables and natural enemies have been largely neglected. To improve our understanding of the ecological factors involved in the evolution of sympatric stickleback species pairs (Gasterosteus aculeatus), I examined whether lakes in the same region with only a solitary population of sticklebacks had unique features not shared with lakes containing stickleback species pairs. Sixteen lakes with a solitary population of sticklebacks were identified as potential candidates for two invasions of marine ancestors. Several physical and chemical characteristics of these candidate lakes were found to be not significantly different from those of lakes with sympatric species pairs. However, when the community of other fish species was considered, a striking pattern emerged: all but one of the 16 candidate lakes contained other fish species in addition to cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki), whereas sympatric species pairs were found only in lakes with cutthroat trout and no other fish species. The two other fish species most often encountered, prickly sculpin (Cottus asper) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), are potential competitors and predators of threespine sticklebacks. The results of this survey suggest that our understanding of the role of ecology in diversification and speciation will be furthered by a consideration of interactions other than interspecific competition between focal populations.},

abstract = {Background: Stickleback fishes are an outstanding model for understanding evolution and ecology. Celebrating successes and identifying new questions, the Seventh International Conference on Stickleback Behaviour and Evolution was held 29 July to 3 August 2012 near Seattle, Washington, USA. Questions: How has research on stickleback shaped our understanding of phenotypic variation, genomic variation, speciation, and eco-evolutionary dynamics? How is future research on stickleback likely to advance these topics? Phenotypic variation: Stickleback show exceptional variation at a diversity of spatial scales, which has yielded insights not only into how natural selection shapes evolutionary diversification, but also how the influence of natural selection can be constrained. Future research would profit from examining temporal variation in selection and the multifarious nature of selection. Genomic variation: Stickleback adapted to different environments show widespread, but heterogeneous, genomic differentiation that is often associated with variation in recombination rate and that shows both parallel and non-parallel patterns. Profitable areas for future research include identifying the links between genotype-phenotype-fitness, the processes generating genomic patterns of differentiation, the mechanisms underlying variation in recombination, and the spread of chromosomal inversions. Speciation: Stickleback research has shaped our understanding of ecological speciation, the factors that promote and constrain it, and the traits involved in reproductive isolation. More work is needed in all these areas, as well as in the genomics of speciation and the alternatives to ecological speciation. Eco-evolutionary dynamics: Stickleback adapted to different environments have differential effects on community and ecosystem variables in mesocosms. Future work should investigate the strength and form of these effects in nature, the importance of plastic and genetic contributions, and the nature of feedbacks between ecology and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Andrew P.

abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment encountered by one generation (F0) alters the phenotypes of one or more future generations (e.g. F1 and F2). Sex selective TGP, via specific lineages or to only male or female descendants, has been underexplored in natural systems, and may be adaptive if it allows past generations to fine-tune the phenotypes of future generations in response to sex-specific life-history strategies. We sought to understand if exposing males to predation risk can influence grandoffspring via sperm in three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. We specifically tested the hypothesis that grandparental effects are transmitted in a sex-specific way down the male lineage, from paternal grandfathers to F2 males. We reared F1 offspring of unexposed and predator-exposed F0 males under ‘control' conditions and used them to generate F2s with control grandfathers, a predator-exposed maternal grandfather (i.e. predator-exposed F0 males to F1 daughters to F2s), a predator-exposed paternal grandfather (i.e. predator-exposed F0 males to F1 sons to F2s) or two predator-exposed grandfathers. We then assayed male and female F2s for a variety of traits related to antipredator defence. We found little evidence that transgenerational effects were mediated to only male descendants via the paternal lineage. Instead, grandpaternal effects depended on lineage and were mediated largely across sexes, from F1 males to F2 females and from F1 females to F2 males. When their paternal grandfather was exposed to predation risk, female F2s were heavier and showed a reduced change in behaviour in response to a simulated predator attack relative to grandoffspring of control, unexposed grandparents. In contrast, male F2s showed reduced antipredator behaviour when their maternal grandfather was exposed to predation risk. However, these patterns were only evident when one grandfather, but not both grandfathers, was exposed to predation risk, suggesting the potential for non-additive interactions across lineages. If sex-specific and lineage effects are common, then grandparental effects are likely underestimated in the literature. These results draw attention to the importance of sex-selective inheritance of environmental effects and raise new questions about the proximate and ultimate causes of selective transmission across generations.},

abstract = {Intergenerational plasticity or parental effects—when parental environments alter the phenotype of future generations—can influence how organisms cope with environmental change. An intriguing, underexplored possibility is that sex—of both the parent and the offspring—plays an important role in driving the evolution of intergenerational plasticity in both adaptive and non-adaptive ways. Here, we evaluate the potential for sex-specific parental effects in a freshwater population of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus by independently and jointly manipulating maternal and paternal experiences and separately evaluating their phenotypic effects in sons versus daughters. We tested the adaptive hypothesis that daughters are more responsive to cues from their mother, whereas sons are more responsive to cues from their father. We exposed mothers, fathers or both parents to visual cues of predation risk and measured offspring antipredator traits and brain gene expression. Predator-exposed fathers produced sons that were more risk-prone, whereas predator-exposed mothers produced more anxious sons and daughters. Furthermore, maternal and paternal effects on offspring survival were non-additive: offspring with a predator-exposed father, but not two predator-exposed parents, had lower survival against live predators. There were also strong sex-specific effects on brain gene expression: exposing mothers versus fathers to predation risk activated different transcriptional profiles in their offspring, and sons and daughters strongly differed in the ways in which their brain gene expression profiles were influenced by parental experience. We found little evidence to support the hypothesis that offspring prioritize their same-sex parent's experience. Parental effects varied with both the sex of the parent and the offspring in complicated and non-additive ways. Failing to account for these sex-specific patterns (e.g. by pooling sons and daughters) would have underestimated the magnitude of parental effects. Altogether, these results draw attention to the potential for sex to influence patterns of intergenerational plasticity and raise new questions about the interface between intergenerational plasticity and sex-specific selective pressures, sexual conflict and sexual selection.},

abstract = {Studies of interspecific competition for space among stream-dwelling salmonid species have employed a variety of methods, most of which have centered on identifying species differences in microhabitat use. Clear demonstration of competition, however, generally requires evidence that interactions produce a niche shift in one or both species. Laboratory channels or aquaria have frequently been used in controlled experiments concerned with salmonid competition. Field measurements typically involve scuba diving or snorkeling techniques, although carefully managed electrofishing studies have also demonstrated habitat differences between species. Stream dwelling salmonid populations may be limited at different times by competition, predation, or climatic events such as droughts or floods. When populations are limited by processes other than competition, competition is of minimal intensity or nonexistent. Long-term coexistence of sympatric species may be partly facilitated by species differences in habitat use which results from species differences in aggressiveness, innate habitat preference, timing of emergence, morphology, or a combination of these factors.},

Threespine sticklebacks were exposed to two different habitat treatments, simple and complex, over a 17-week period.

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occurrence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climate-induced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mackerel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distribution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher production or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {The endemic radiation of the threespine stickleback in North America possesses features that will permit us to gain unique insights into evolutionary pattern and process. Already, comparison of populations has demonstrated a remarkable level of adaptive differentiation in reproductive behavior across populations in both southern British Columbia, Canada, and the Cook Inlet Region of Alaska, U.S.A. In small, shallow lakes, threespine stickleback feed predominantly on benthic invertebrates in the shallow littoral zone. They form large groups that attack nests defended by males, and consume all of the young within. In contrast, in larger, more oligotrophic lakes, adult stickleback feed primarily on plankton in large open-water foraging groups. They do not form groups that cannibalize young in nests. In these non-cannibalistic populations, males perform more conspicuous courtship behavior than do those in cannibalistic populations, apparently because risk of attack by visually hunting conspecifics is low. Courtship in these lakes more often includes the conspicuous zig-zag dance, and less often, meandering and dorsal pricking. Anadromous populations tend to be cannibalistic, but also are often behaviorally intermediate. They incorporate the zig-zag dance in courtship more often than do males in cannibalistic freshwater populations, but also usually incorporate the less conspicuous dorsal pricking behavior. These results suggest that the ancestral condition was intermediate and that both cannibalistic and non-cannibalistic freshwater populations display some derived elements in their reproductive repertoires. This kind of comparison among populations thought to have been independently derived from the marine form can provide insights into the patterns and causes of adaptive diversification. For populations such as these, carefully chosen from disparate geographic locations so as to preclude common evolutionary history after colonization of freshwater, an unresolved polytomy is probably the best phylogenetic model. For closely-spaced lakes within drainages, branching trees, reflecting gene flow after colonization, are probably more realistic models. Resolution of such phylogeographic relationships requires the acqui- sition of appropriate molecular data. Both approaches, with their implicitely historical view of character evolution, provide windows that will permit us an unusually clear view of historical changes in behavioral phenotypes and of their causes. {\textcopyright} 1995, Brill.

abstract = {Although antipredator behavior of threespine stickleback has been extensively studied in the laboratory, interactions between stickleback and their predators in nature have never been described. This paper describes interactions between territorial male stickleback and four predators on males or on the young they guard. Two of the predators, cutthroat trout and a hemipteran nymph (Belostomatidae), prey on males but not on young. Another, the roughskin newt, is a potential predator of young but does not pose a threat to males. Prickly sculpin prey both on the males and on offspring that males guard. Differences in behavior toward the four predators indicate that males are capable of rapid discrimination among predators and the threats they pose. Males also discriminate among size classes of sculpin that present different predation risks, but not among size classes of trout large enough to pose a threat. The difference in response to these predators probably reflects the difference in risk to offspring and the amount of time each predator typically stays in the territory of a male. Trout pass through rapidly, whereas sculpin, which are ambush predators, can remain within a territory for a long period of time if not chased out. The presence of young in the nest had no apparent effect on the response of males to these predators. This could, however, be due to a masking effect of uncontrolled variation in natural encounters. Responses to newts were similar to those directed toward sculpin too small to attack the male. They involved rapid chases and bites, often directed at the head, a part of the body that was typically avoided in encounters with larger sculpin. Males watch and avoid the belostomatid nymphs, but do not attack them. 1990 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract = {In Crystal Lake, British Columbia, small fry (≤15 mm SL) of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) are concentrated in vegetation while larger fry are not. Because fry in all size classes feed primarily on zooplankton, even when in vegetation, we hypothesized that size-limited predation was responsible for the observed shift in habitat use with size. The major predators on fry in Crystal Lake are adult threespine stickleback, the water scorpion, Ranatra sp. (Hemiptera: Nepidae), backswimmers, Notonecta spp. (Hemiptera: Notonectidae), and dragonfly naiads of the genus Aeshna (Odonata: Aeschnidae). On the basis of distribution and hunting behavior we excluded the insects Ranatra sp., and Notonecta sp. as causal agents for this shift in resource by fry in water >0.25 m deep. Ranatra was found almost exclusively near the shoreline in water <0.25 m deep, and both insects hunted primarily as ambush predators within vegetation. Such predators seemed more likely to drive vulnerable fry from vegetation than to restrict them to it. In contrast, Aeshna naiads and adult stickleback frequently hunted outside of vegetation. In prey preference experiments the naiads did not show the decline in predation efficiency on fry >15 mm SL that would be expected if size-limited predation by this insect was responsible for the observed shift in resource use by fry. Adult stickleback only fed on fry <15 mm SL, and in an experimental situation, consumed fry at a rate 10 times greater than that exhibited by any of the insects. Predation experiments demonstrated that small fry (11-15 mm) spent more time in vegetation in the presence of adult conspecifics than they did in control pools, as would be expected if size-limited cannibalism caused small, vulnerable fry to be restricted to vegetation. Fry >15 mm SL were found outside of vegetation more often than in control treatments. The probable cause of this result is that adults become aggressive toward fry at this size, and often could be seen chasing large fry from vegetation during the experiments. Dragonfly naiads (Aeshna spp.) spent most of their time in vegetation in the experimental pools. Both size classes of fry spent less time in vegetation in the presence of dragonfly naiads than they did in control treatments, an apparent reflection of their similar vulnerabilities to these naiads. The presence of vegetation in pools reduced predation rates by adult stickleback on small fry. Because the experiments presented here indicate that fry are capable of rapidly assessing predation risk and of altering their behavior adaptively, we conclude that small fry occupy vegetation as a refuge from cannibalism. Once fry have reached the size-threshold at which they are no longer vulnerable to adult conspecifics they are able to forage farther from vegetation thereby reducing risk of predation by insects in vegetation and possibly acquiring more abundant food resources. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

Here, we present a novel strategy to address this challenge by studying salinity adaptation in the threespine stickleback, a fish species with diverse salt-handling ecotypes. We acclimated native freshwater (FW) and anadromous saltwater (SW) threespine sticklebacks to fresh, brackish, and sea water for 30 days, and applied RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression in fish kidneys. We identified 1844 salt-responsive genes that were differentially expressed between FW sticklebacks acclimated to different salinities and/or between SW and FW sticklebacks acclimated to full-strength sea water. Significant overlap between stickleback salt-responsive genes and human genes implicated in HTN was detected (P < 10-7, hypergeometric test), suggesting a possible similarity in genetic mechanisms of salt handling between threespine sticklebacks and humans. The overlapping genes included a newly discovered HTN gene-MAP3K15, whose expression in FW stickleback kidneys decreases with salinity. These also included genes located in the GWAS loci such as AGTRAP-PLOD1 and CYP1A1-ULK3, which contain multiple potentially causative genes contributing to HTN susceptibility that need to be prioritized for study. Taken together, we show that stickleback salt-responsive genes provide valuable information facilitating the identification of human HTN genes. Thus, threespine sticklebacks may be used as a model, complementary to existing animal models, in human HTN research.},

However, entirely predictable or entirely unpredictable conditions are rarely found in nature. Intermediate strategies are required when the time lag between information sensing and phenotype induction is large (e.g., transgenerational plasticity) and when cues are only partially predictive of future conditions. Nevertheless, current theory regards plasticity and bet-hedging as distinct entities. We here develop a unifying framework: based on traits with binary outcomes like seed germination or diapause incidence we clarify that diversified bet-hedging (risk-spreading among one's offspring) and transgenerational plasticity are mutually exclusive strategies, arising from opposing changes in reaction norms (allocating phenotypic variance among or within environments). We further explain the relationship of this continuum with arithmetic mean maximization vs. conservative bet-hedging (a risk-avoidance strategy), and canalization vs. phenotypic variance in a three-dimensional continuum of reaction norm evolution. We discuss under which scenarios costs and limits may constrain the evolution of reaction norm shapes.},

abstract = {Sympatric species pairs of benthic and limnetic threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L., 1758 complex) are an important example of the role of ecology in speciation in nature. Four endemic pairs are known and each appears to have diverged independently as a consequence of adaptation to alternative environments. Using specific ecological and physical attributes hypothesized to be important to their evolution, we focused a search for further species pairs. Now, two decades after the last discovery, we describe another benthic-limnetic species pair from Little Quarry Lake on Nelson Island, British Columbia, Canada. Bimodality of genetic admixture values provides evidence of strong reproductive isolation between two morphological and genetic clusters, supporting the existence of a sympatric species pair within this lake. Close correspondence in shape to extant benthic and limnetic species pairs confirm their status as such. The remarkable similarity between them and other benthic and limnetic species pairs in levels of morphological differentiation, as well as extent of admixture and hybridization, points to similar processes underlying their origin. This discovery serves as an important reminder of the specificity of ecological factors that promote and maintain biodiversity, as well as the value of habitat conservation. {\textcopyright} 2008 NRC Canada.},

abstract = {We examine evidence for the structuring of fish communities from stream and lake systems and the roles of biotic, abiotic, and spatial factors in determining the species composition. Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.},

abstract = {Ecology and evolution have long been recognized as reciprocally influencing each other, with recent research emphasizing how such interactions can occur even on very short (contemporary) time scales. Given that these interactions are mediated by organismal phenotypes, they can be variously shaped by genetic variation, phenotypic plasticity, or both. I here address 8 key questions relevant to the role of plasticity in eco-evolutionary dynamics. Focusing on empirical evidence, especially from natural populations, I offer the following conclusions. 1) Plasticity is-not surprisingly-sometimes adaptive, sometimes maladaptive, and sometimes neutral. 2) Plasticity has costs and limits but these constraints are highly variable, often weak, and hard to detect. 3) Variable environments favor the evolution of increased trait plasticity, which can then buffer fitness/performance (i.e., tolerance). 4) Plasticity sometimes Aids colonization of new environments (Baldwin Effect) and responses to in situ environmental change. However, plastic responses are not always necessary or sufficient in these contexts. 5) Plasticity will sometimes promote and sometimes constrain genetic evolution. 6) Plasticity will sometimes help and sometimes hinder ecological speciation but, at present, empirical tests are limited. 7) Plasticity can show considerable evolutionary change in contemporary time, although the rates of this reaction norm evolution are highly variable among taxa and traits. 8) Plasticity appears to have considerable influences on ecological dynamics at the community and ecosystem levels, although many more studies are needed. In summary, plasticity needs to be an integral part of any conceptual framework and empirical investigation of eco-evolutionary dynamics.},

abstract = {Background: The influence of human activity on ecological communities can be mediated as well as modulated by species with a central role in regulating community composition. The threespine stickleback is a common species in temperate aquatic ecosystems that could serve such a role. Question: Does the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) modulate the impact of human-induced eutrophication on ecological communities? If so, what are the pathways and mechanisms? Methods: Review of studies investigating the influence of eutrophication on the dynamics and characteristics of stickleback populations, and how changes to the population mediate and modify the impact of eutrophication on other species. Results: Eutrophication influences the abundance and characteristics of stickleback, which impacts other species through density- and trait-mediated effects on species interactions and the habitat. The effects can be complex and include feedback loops, and extend far beyond the stickleback population through the myriad of linkages among species. The changes can interact with other changes to the ecosystem, such as species invasions and climate change, and further alter the impact of ecological disturbances. Conclusions: The threespine stickleback modulates the effects of eutrophication on communities and alters ecological and evolutionary processes. However, relatively little is known about the ultimate effects on ecosystems. Thus the complexity of ecological network architecture needs to be considered by combining experimental investigations of linkages among species with whole-ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {Behavioral flexibility is an important adaptive response to changing environments for many animal species. Such plasticity may also promote the invasion of novel habitats by introduced species by providing them with the ability to expand or change their ecological niche, a longstanding idea with recent empirical support. At the individual level, flexibility may arise through innovation, in which an individual invents a new behavior, or through social learning, in which an individual adopts a behavior used by others. There is increasing evidence that the adaptive value of these two modes of learning, and the overall expression of behavioral flexibility, may vary with social and environmental context. In this paper, we propose that invasive species may change the degree to which they express behavioral flexibility in an adaptive manner during the different stages of invasion. Specifically, the adaptive flexibility hypothesis predicts that the expression of behavioral flexibility, and thus the diversity of behaviors observed in a population, will be high during the initial stage of introduction into a novel environment due to innovation, followed by a decline in behavioral diversity during the establishment and growth of a founding population due to social learning of successful behavioral variants. We discuss several alternatives to this hypothesis and suggest empirical and theoretical tests of these hypotheses. This adaptive flexibility hypothesis suggests that a more nuanced approach to the study of the behaviors employed by individuals in populations at different invasion stages could generate new insight into the importance of such flexibility during species invasions, and the evolution of behavioral plasticity in general. {\textcopyright} 2010 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Universit{\`{a}}, Firenze, Italia.},

abstract = {Background: Organismal fitness can be determined at early life-stages, but phenotypic variation at early life-stages is rarely considered in studies on evolutionary diversification. The trophic apparatus has been shown to contribute to sympatric resource-mediated divergence in several taxa. However, processes underlying diversification in trophic traits are poorly understood. Using phenotypically variable Icelandic Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), we reared offspring from multiple families under standardized laboratory conditions and tested to what extent family (i.e. direct genetic and maternal effects) contributes to offspring morphology at hatching (H) and first feeding (FF). To understand the underlying mechanisms behind early life-stage variation in morphology, we examined how craniofacial shape varied according to family, offspring size, egg size and candidate gene expression. Results: Craniofacial shape (i.e. the Meckel's cartilage and hyoid arch) was more variable between families than within families both across and within developmental stages. Differences in craniofacial morphology between developmental stages correlated with offspring size, whilst within developmental stages only shape at FF correlated with offspring size, as well as female mean egg size. Larger offspring and offspring from females with larger eggs consistently had a wider hyoid arch and contracted Meckel's cartilage in comparison to smaller offspring. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for family-level variation in early life-stage trophic morphology, indicating the potential for parental effects to facilitate resource polymorphism.},

abstract = {We conducted an experiment to assess the change in foraging efficiency resulting from diet-induced morphological and behavioural plasticity in a species of freshwater, threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus sp.). Different degrees of morphological and behavioural change were induced using two prey items commonly found in the diet of this species, allowing us to estimate the relative importance of each type of plasticity. The purpose of the experiment was twofold. First, earlier work had suggested that diet variability might be an important factor in the evolution of trophic morphological plasticity in sticklebacks. The present results extend this work by revealing the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity. The current experiment also qualitatively assessed the compatibility of the time scale of morphological change with that of the natural resource variability experienced by this species. The results indicate that diet-induced plasticity improves foraging efficiency continuously for up to 72 days of prey exposure. This is probably due in part to plasticity of the external trophic morphology but our results also suggest a complex interplay between morphology and behaviour. The time scale appears to be matched to that of natural diet variability although it is possible that some traits exhibit non-labile plasticity. Our discussion highlights the important distinction between conditions favouring the evolution of labile versus non-labile plasticity. The second objective of the experiment was to determine the relative importance of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Few studies have attempted to quantify the adaptive significance of morphological plasticity and no study to our knowledge has separated the effects of morphological and behavioural plasticity. Our experiment reveals that both behavioural and morphological plasticity are important and it also suggests a dichotomy between the two: behavioural plasticity predominately affects searching efficiency whereas morphological plasticity predominately affects handling efficiency.},

abstract = {The process of vicariance is the reasonable starting hypothesis for all biogeographical analyses explaining a disjointed distribution because it involves the least amount of assumptions. However, when studying a biogeographical scenario, it often appears that the initial hypothesis is not supported by the data, whether the data come from phylogenetic analyses or paleontological occurrences. Therefore, as we observed previously, including dispersal events is necessary for explaining several distribution patterns, even for ancient clades like the osteoglossomorphs. Including dispersal events when building paleobiogeographical scenarios is often considered to be a methodological weakness because these events cannot be directly observed in the fossil record. For primary freshwater fishes, dispersals across marine barriers involved exceptional phenomena such as displacements on “freshwater rafts”, very strong discharges of freshwater by large rivers or other extraordinary events (transport by other organisms, tornadoes, etc.). These rare events are not impossible throughout geological time, but they are indemonstrable and are therefore to be avoided during paleobiogeographical reconstructions. There is also another methodological problem that is often considered unacceptable by biogeographers when constructing scenarios. It consists of considering the absence of a fossil in a given time and place as a usable observation, as was the case in several of the scenarios presented before. These absences are considered to be evidence, or at least indications, of real absences. Although it is true that the statement “the absence of evidence is evidence of absence” is problematic in itself and poses problems when discussing recent periods and very specific locations, it is admissible for much larger scales of time and space (for example both the fossil absence of ostariophysans in the Paleozoic and of cypriniforms in South America correspond to real absences). An innovative quantitative approach that should be applied to a variety of clades is to estimate the probability of the presence of a taxon in fossiliferous layers according to a method used by Friedman et al. This method provides the interval of time that is considered most credible for the appearance of a clade on the basis of the distribution of horizons containing fossils of this clade in a specific area.},

abstract = {Background: The extent and importance of sexual dimorphism in non-sexually selected traits has received considerable attention in studies of birds and reptiles but similar studies in fishes are limited. Aim: Quantify the extent and direction of sexual dimorphism in both defence and trophic traits of adult threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Methods: We amassed data from research done on 103 ecologically pristine stream and lake localities on the Haida Gwaii archipelago, western Canada. Using these data, we tested many hypotheses of ecological correlation with variability in the amount of dimorphism. We used a nested ANOVA with principal components and individual size-corrected morphometric traits as the dependent variables, with sex (male, female), water clarity (stained, clear) and water body (stream, small lake, large lake) as fixed factors, and locality as a random factor. Results: Adult body length (SL) is mainly female-biased but this is accentuated in large clear water lakes. Dorsal and anal fin ray numbers are male-biased, the dimorphism being greater in clear water than stained lakes. The number of bony lateral plates is male-biased in most habitats except for large clear water lakes, which are female-biased. Relative size of the pelvis (spine length, ventral plate length) is female-biased in most habitats. Relative head length, head depth, jaw length, and eye diameter are male-biased in most populations. Dual isotopic signatures of muscle tissues of adult male stickleback in 33 populations show a higher trophic level ($\delta$15N) but no consistent differences in $\delta$13C. In a single locality where multiple size classes were located, males show a steeper ontogenetic slope of $\delta$15N against SL than do females, resulting in their signatures being depleted relative to sub-adult females but enriched relative to adult females. Stickleback from two localities sampled over several decades exhibit substantial temporal variability in the extent of the isotopic sexual dimorphism. Conclusions: Sexual dimorphism in stickleback is widespread in multiple morphometric traits not directly associated with sexual selection. Population differences in the extent and direction of dimorphism are related to niche separation across predator and trophic gradients within localities and reflect general diversifying selection within populations.},

abstract = {A major goal of evolutionary science is to understand how biological diversity is generated and altered. Despite considerable advances, we still have limited insight into how phenotypic variation arises and is sorted by natural selection. Here we argue that an integrated view, which merges ecology, evolution and developmental biology (eco evo devo) on an equal footing, is needed to understand the multifaceted role of the environment in simultaneously determining the development of the phenotype and the nature of the selective environment, and how organisms in turn affect the environment through eco evo and eco devo feedbacks. To illustrate the usefulness of an integrated eco evo devo perspective, we connect it with the theory of resource polymorphism (i.e. the phenotypic and genetic diversification that occurs in response to variation in available resources). In so doing, we highlight fishes from recently glaciated freshwater systems as exceptionally well-suited model systems for testing predictions of an eco evo devo framework in studies of diversification. Studies on these fishes show that intraspecific diversity can evolve rapidly, and that this process is jointly facilitated by (i) the availability of diverse environments promoting divergent natural selection; (ii) dynamic developmental processes sensitive to environmental and genetic signals; and (iii) eco evo and eco devo feedbacks influencing the selective and developmental environments of the phenotype. We highlight empirical examples and present a conceptual model for the generation of resource polymorphism – emphasizing eco evo devo, and identify current gaps in knowledge.},

We tested the ability of larval threespine sticklebacks to adjust their foraging in the presence of predators by exposing them to conspecific predators of various sizes and recording their foraging and predator avoidance behaviours. Larvae (<30 days post-hatch) displayed predator escape behaviours only towards attacking predators. At 3 weeks post-hatch larvae approached the predator after fleeing, a behaviour which may be the precursor to predator inspection. Larvae reduced foraging and spent less time in the proximity of large and medium-sized predators compared to small predators. The reduction in foraging was negatively correlated to the predator/larva size ratio, indicating that larvae increased their foraging as they increased in size relative to the predator. We conclude that larval sticklebacks can assess the threat of predation early in their ontogeny and adjust their behaviour accordingly. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag.},

We found that sticklebacks from high predation populations breathed faster in response to confinement stress and were, on an average, more behaviorally responsive to a pike behind glass compared with sticklebacks from low predation populations. These patterns differ from the results of studies on other species, highlighting the need for a conceptual framework to understand the proximate and ultimate factors shaping variable responses to stressors over developmental and evolutionary time. Moreover, physiological and behavioral responses were integrated with each other, both at the individual and population levels. In general, fish that were more aggressive and bold in the presence of a predator breathed faster, independent of body size. These results are consistent with the growing body of evidence that individuals differ in a suite of physiological and behavioral mechanisms for coping with challenges in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Resource-use polymorphisms are associations between heritable phenotypic variation and habitat use within populations. These polymorphisms can offer insights into the mechanisms by which adaptation can occur despite gene flow, and into the importance of these mechanisms for the formation of new species. Resource-use polymorphisms are relatively common in northern freshwater fishes, including the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) complex. This complex exhibits parallel trophic variation at three nested levels: (1) species differences, (2) ecotypic variation across populations and (3) polytypy within populations. Of these levels, polytypic variation has been the least well characterized in the threespine stickleback, having been detected in only two populations (Benka Lake, Alaska; Cranby Lake, British Columbia). In each lake, individuals are specialized in body shape and trophic morphology along the benthic (bottom feeding) to limnetic (plankton feeding) axis. The morphotypes in each population differ in habitat use and diet. Here we demonstrate that in Benka Lake, Alaska, females of the two ecotypes also differ in reproductive allocation, with benthic females producing fewer, larger eggs. Our results offer the first evidence of reproductive life-history differences between morphotypes of stickleback within a single population. The difference in egg size between the morphotypes may reflect plasticity paralleling that in other aspects of the phenotype. We believe, however, it is more likely that the association between morphology and egg size is favoured by disruptive selection on fry size imposed by differences in water temperature between the habitats in which the morphotypes breed. Assortative mating in Benka Lake apparently has led to more pervasive phenotype divergence than previously suspected and possibly even to incipient sympatric speciation. {\textcopyright} 2005 John A.

Here, we review examples of how these developmental effects are manifested in life-history traits from studies of various fish species, with examples of impacts on somatic growth, age at migration and maturation, allocation of resources to gonads and egg size. Temperature during embryogenesis appears important for some behavioural decisions, such as when maturing Atlantic salmon Salmo salar return home from the ocean for spawning in distant rivers during summer. In some species, early temperature influences sex determination. The temperature level during embryogenesis may preadapt the fish to maximize offspring production under the thermal conditions encountered at the embryo stage. This thermal influence is a phenotypically plastic response that triggers polyphenism in salmonids and may be a first step in speciation of North American darters (Perci-dae). The responses to early temperature appear to be regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and micro RNAs.},

To better understand the ecology of wild and stocked fry, we investigated the dispersal, growth, and food composition of advanced pike fry (∼30 mm) stocked at a high density at a common release site in a shallow natural lake that contained wild young-of-the-year (age-0) pike. The stocked pike fry colonized the entire lake shoreline within just a few days. Dispersal was inversely related to size at stocking, suggesting that smaller fish were displaced by competitively superior larger individuals. While the stocked pike were initially larger than the wild age-0 pike, suboptimal growth was evident among the stocked pike and they were smaller than the wild ones at the end of the growing season. Stomach analyses revealed that the stocked pike ingested less diverse prey items and had higher fractions of empty stomachs throughout the study period. Overall, the fraction of stocked pike in samples rapidly declined over the season, which may have been caused by differential survival or immigration into or emigration out of the study system. Our study adds to the existing literature suggesting that the stocking of age-0 northern pike into waters with naturally reproducing pike populations will result in limited success. We propose two potentially complementary explanations for the apparent low fitness of stocked individuals in competition with wild conspecifics: (1) genetic-based local maladaptation among the stocked fish and (2) carryover effects from the hatchery. The latter may be less likely because the fry stocked were the offspring of wild fish and only spent a few weeks in the hatchery. {\textcopyright} American Fisheries Society 2011.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In basic intraguild predation (IGP) systems, predators and prey also compete for a shared resource. Theory predicts that persistence of these systems is possible when intraguild prey is superior in competition and productivity is not too high. IGP often results from ontogenetic niche shifts, in which the diet of intraguild predators changes as a result of growth in body size (life-history omnivory). As a juvenile, a life-history omnivore competes with the species that becomes its prey later in life. Competition can hence limit growth of young predators, while adult predators can suppress consumers and therewith neutralize negative effects of competition. We formulate and analyze a stage-structured model that captures both basic IGP and life-history omnivory. The model predicts increasing coexistence of predators and consumers when resource use of stage-structured predators becomes more stage specific. This coexistence depends on adult predators requiring consumer biomass for reproduction and is less likely when consumers outcompete juvenile predators, in contrast to basic IGP. Therefore, coexistence occurs when predation structures the community and competition is negligible. Consequently, equilibrium patterns over productivity resemble those of three-species food chains. Life-history omnivory thus provides a mechanism that allows intraguild predators and prey to coexist over a wide range of resource productivity. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

There are strong overlapping conceptual links between conservation and evo-devo whereby both fields focus on evolutionary potential. In particular, benefits to conservation can be derived from some of the main areas of evo-devo research, namely phenotypic plasticity, modularity and integration, and mechanistic investigations of the precise developmental and genetic processes that determine phenotypes.

(3) Site A had a greater abundance of potential prey than site B. Within each site, areas with abundant aquatic vegetation had higher densities of potential prey than vegetation- poor areas. (4) Adults of all four species appeared in the breeding areas in early May and were longer present by the end of June. Juveniles appeared in late June, except for juvenile wheatlandi which did not appear until July because of their later breeding period. Juvenile Gasterosteus left the breeding areas by late August, while juvenile A. quadracus pungitius remained. (5) Food niche overlap was greatest between adult G. aculeatus and P. pungitius, while adult G. wheatlandi overlapped least with any species. Where A. quadracus was found sympatry with the other species, overlap occurred with G. aculeatus and P. pungitius. same relationships held for juveniles. (6) In four of the five areas, niche breadth and overlap were greater in areas of high potential-prey density and lower in areas of low potential-prey density. In the fifth niche overlap was high at low potential-prey densities. Because niche breadth varied between sites, no firm conclusions could be drawn about niche breadth relationships between the species. (7) Adult and juvenile sticklebacks exhibited similar microhabitat partitioning, although it was more pronounced in juveniles. A. quadracus fed predominantly from the benthos, while G. wheatlandi fed mainly in the water column. G. aculeatus and P. pungitius fed from both the benthos and water column. P. pungitius usually foraged amongst algal mats. (8) It is proposed that interspecific competition was not a factor in these environments, because of the abundance of potential prey and microhabitat segregation},

This study examines the consequences of predation on the fitness of a pair of lacustrine stickleback species (Gasterosteus aculeatus complex) and their F1 hybrids. Benthic sticklebacks are found in the littoral zone of lakes associated with vegetation and bare sediments, whereas limnetic sticklebacks spend most of their lives in the pelagic zone. The cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) is a major predator of sticklebacks and the only other fish species native to lakes containing both benthic and limnetic species. In pond experiments we found that the addition of these predators primarily impacted the survival of limnetics. By contrast, benthic survival was unaffected by trout addition. The result was that relative survival of benthics and limnetics was reversed in the presence of trout. The presence of trout had no effect on the rank order of parent species growth rates, with benthics always growing faster than limnetics. F1 hybrids survived poorly relative to benthics and limnetics and their growth rates were intermediate regardless of treatment. The results implicate predation by trout in the divergence of the species but not through increased vulnerability of F1 hybrids.},

About 85% of the affected patients present de novo mutations in the TBX5gene. The aim of this study is to propose a molecular strategy to diagnose patients with clinical suspicion of HOS. Patients and methods: A sequence analysis of 7 patients from exon 2 to exon 8 of the TBX5 gene was performed. MLPAp179 and MLPAp180 were performed in those cases in which no mutation was found. Results: p.Arg270X and p.Ala34Glyfsx27 mutations were identified in 2 cases. These cases fulfilled the strict clinical criteria, had a family history of HOS and had similar clinical features. In other three cases, MLPA results showed deletions of the GLI3 coding region. Conclusions: In order to increase the TBX5 mutation detection rate, an exhaustive physical examination focused on the strict clinical criteria may be necessary to rule out clinical overlapping syndromes.

These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation, field and laboratory experiments, and physiological research. Range-restricted species, particularly polar and mountaintop species, show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change. Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected. Predator-prey and plant-insect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming. Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species' ranges, and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins. Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change, but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level.

Methanol extracted less chlorophyll than acetone from fresh sediment samples. The ratio between the amount of chlorophyll extracted with methanol and acetone increased with decreasing water content of the sample. When sediments were freeze-dried prior to extraction of chlorophyll, the extraction efficiency increased between 3.4 and 10.0 times compared with fresh samples. It is suggested that the higher extraction efficiency for freeze-dried samples is due to reduction in water content and pulverization of the sediment, allowing improved exposure to the solvent. As a result of these studies freeze-drying, prior to extraction in acetone (90%) or ethanol (96%), is recommended as the best available method for quantification of chlorophyll a in sediments.},

Here, we combine genetic, morphological and ecological data to assess species and ecomorphological diversity of Artic charr in six lakes of a catchment in southernmost Greenland, where only charr and stickleback occur. Because the diversity of habitats and resources increases with lake size, we predict a positive association between lake size and the extent of ecomorphological diversity. The largest lake of the catchment harbours the largest Arctic charr assemblage known today. It consists of six genetically differentiated species belonging to five ecomorphs (anadromous, littoral benthic, profundal dwarf, planktivorous, piscivorous), of which the latter comprises two ecomorphologically extremely similar species. Lakes of intermediate size contain two ecomorphologically and genetically distinct species. Small lakes harbour one genetically homogeneous, yet sometimes ecomorphologically variable population. Supporting our prediction, lake size is positively correlated with the extent of ecomorphological specialization towards profundal, pelagic and piscivorous lifestyle. Furthermore, assemblage-wide morphospace increases sharply when more than one genetic cluster is present. Our data suggest that ecological opportunity and speciation jointly determine phenotypic expansion in this charr radiation.},

abstract = {The three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is an important model system for the study of parallel evolution in the wild, having repeatedly colonized and adapted to freshwater from the sea throughout the northern hemisphere. Previous studies identified numerous genomic regions showing consistent genetic differentiation between freshwater and marine ecotypes but these had typically limited geographic sampling and mostly focused on the Eastern Pacific region. We analysed population genomic data from global samples of the three-spined stickleback marine and freshwater ecotypes to detect loci involved in parallel evolution at different geographic scales. Most signatures of parallel evolution were unique to the Eastern Pacific and trans-oceanic marine–freshwater differentiation was restricted to a limited number of shared genomic regions, including three chromosomal inversions. On the basis of simulations and empirical data, we demonstrate that this could result from the stochastic loss of freshwater-adapted alleles during the invasion of the Atlantic basin and selection against freshwater-adapted variants in the sea, both of which can reduce standing genetic variation available for freshwater adaptation outside the Eastern Pacific region. Moreover, the elevated linkage disequilibrium associated with marine–freshwater differentiation in the Eastern Pacific is consistent with secondary contact between marine and freshwater populations that evolved in isolation from each other during past glacial periods. Thus, contrary to what earlier studies from the Eastern Pacific region have led us to believe, parallel marine–freshwater differentiation in sticklebacks is far less prevalent and pronounced in all other parts of the species global distribution range.},

abstract = {The idea that selection may be fundamental to the origin of species dates back at least to the synthesis of modern evolutionary theory, being present in the writings of Fisher (1930), Muller (1942), and Dobzhansky (1951). Nevertheless, despite almost three-quarters of a century since the idea was first proposed, little progress has been made in testing the role of selection in speciation (Coyne 1992; Schluter 1996a, 2001; Futuyma 1998). As the various chapters of this volume attest, however, the topic is enjoying a resurgence of interest (see also Schluter 2001). The purpose of this chapter is to summarize tests for the role of selection in speciation in a natural system: the sympatric populations of limnetic and benthic threespine sticklebacks that inhabit postglacial lakes in British Columbia, Canada (Plate 2). Our investigation specifically addresses the role of divergent selection between environments and niches in the origin of reproductive isolation, and the role of reinforcement in its completion. Throughout, we adopt Mayr's (1942) biological species concept, in which species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations that are isolated reproductively from other such groups. We broaden this definition slightly to recognize that imperfect reproductive isolation can exist between species that nevertheless maintain their distinctiveness in nature (Rundle et al. 2001).},

Such experiments provide two types of information, knowledge about genetic architecture and insight into evolutionary dynamics. They can be roughly classified into two types: (1) artificial selection in which the experimenter selects on a focal trait or trait index, and (2) quasi-natural selection in which the experimenter establishes a set of environmental conditions and then allows the population to evolve. Both approaches have been used in the study of phenotypic plasticity. Artificial selection experiments have taken various forms including: selection directly on a reaction norm, selection on a trait in multiple environments, and selection on a trait in a single environment. In the latter experiments, evolution of phenotypic plasticity is investigated as a correlated response. Quasi-natural selection experiments have examined the effects of both spatial and temporal variation. I describe how to carry out such experiments, summarize past efforts, and suggest further avenues of research.},

Temporal variation in breeding time can have severe fitness consequences for the offspring, but the interplay between adult reproductive decisions and offspring phenotypes remains poorly understood. Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) is a potential mechanism allowing rapid responses to environmental change. Here, we investigated if experimentally delayed breeding induces TGP in larval life-history traits in the moor frog (Rana arvalis). We found clear evidence of TGP in response to changes in breeding phenology: delayed breeding increased offspring development and growth rates in the absence of external cues. This constitutes the first unequivocal evidence for TGP in response to changes in breeding phenology in vertebrates. TGP can play an important role in adjusting offspring life-history strategies to the environment they are most likely to encounter, and may constitute an important mechanism for coping with climate change.},

abstract = {Transgenerational plasticity (TGP) occurs when the environment experienced by a parent influences the development of their offspring. In this article, we develop a framework for understanding the mechanisms and multigenerational consequences of TGP. First, we conceptualize the mechanisms of TGP in the context of communication between parents (senders) and offspring (receivers) by dissecting the steps between an environmental cue received by a parent and its resulting effects on the phenotype of one or more future generations. Breaking down the problem in this way highlights the diversity of mechanisms likely to be involved in the process. Second, we review the literature on multigenerational effects and find that the documented patterns across generations are diverse. We categorize different multigenerational patterns and explore the proximate and ultimate mechanisms that can generate them. Throughout, we highlight opportunities for future work in this dynamic and integrative area of study.},

In fish, which have been widely used to test such questions, exposure to different diets is the most frequently described initiator of plastic responses. The effect of physical characteristics of the habitat on fish morphology has not been fully explored. In the present study, a clear effect of habitat complexity on fish shape was found. Threespine sticklebacks were exposed to two different habitat treatments, simple and complex, over a 17-week period. The exposure to the habitats resulted in the expression of very significant differences in body and head morphologies and spine position, showing that the physical environment can modulate the expression of traits through phenotypic plasticity during ontogeny. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London.},

Our results reveal that while the structure of phenotypic covariance is conserved in marine and freshwater forms, it may be disrupted in the progeny of artificial crosses or during rapid adaptive divergence events.

abstract = {Background: The evolution of ecological divergence in closely related species is a key component of adaptive radiation. However, in most examples of adaptive radiation the mechanistic basis of ecological divergence remains unclear. A classic example is seen in the young benthic and limnetic stickleback species pairs of British Columbia. In each pair the benthic species feeds on littoral macroinvertebrates whereas the limnetic feeds on pelagic zooplankton. Previous studies indicate that in both short-term feeding trials and long-term enclosure studies, benthics and limnetics exhibit enhanced performance on their own resource but fare more poorly on the other species' resource. We examined the functional basis of ecological divergence in the stickleback species pair from Paxton Lake, BC, using biomechanical models of fish feeding applied to morphological traits. We examined the consequences of morphological differences using high speed video of feeding fish. Results: Benthic stickleback possess morphological traits that predict high suction generation capacity, including greatly hypertrophied epaxial musculature. In contrast, limnetic stickleback possess traits thought to enhance capture of evasive planktonic prey, including greater jaw protrusion than benthics and greater displacement advantage in both the lower jaw-opening lever system and the opercular four-bar linkage. Kinematic data support the expectations from the morphological analysis that limnetic stickleback exhibit faster strikes and greater jaw protrusion than benthic fish, whereas benthics exert greater suction force on attached prey. Conclusions: We reveal a previously unknown suite of complex morphological traits that affect rapid ecological divergence in sympatric stickleback. These results indicate that postglacial divergence in stickleback involves many functional systems and shows the value of investigating the functional consequences of phenotypic divergence in adaptive radiation. {\textcopyright} 2013 McGee et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {For over a century, evolutionary biologists have debated whether and how phenotypic plasticity impacts the processes of adaptation and diversification. The empirical tests required to resolve these issues have proven elusive, mainly because it requires documentation of ancestral reaction norms, a difficult prospect where many ancestors are either extinct or have evolved. The threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) radiation is not limited in this regard, making it an ideal system in which to address general questions regarding the role of plasticity in adaptive evolution. As retreating ice sheets have exposed new habitats, oceanic stickleback founded innumerable freshwater populations, many of which have evolved parallel adaptations to their new environments. Because the founding oceanic population is extant, we can directly evaluate whether specific patterns of ancestral phenotypic expression in the context of novel environments (plasticity), or over ontogeny, predisposed the repeated evolution of 'benthic' and 'limnetic' ecotypes in shallow and deep lakes, respectively. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that oceanic stickleback raised in a complex habitat and fed a macroinvertebrate diet expressed traits resembling derived, benthic fish. Alternatively, when reared in a simple environment on a diet of zooplankton, oceanic stickleback developed phenotypes resembling derived, limnetic fish. As fish in both treatments grew, their body depths increased allometrically, as did the size of their mouths, while their eyes became relatively smaller. Allometric trajectories were subtly but significantly impacted by rearing environment. Thus, both environmental and allometric influences on development, along with their interactive effects, produced variation in phenotypes consistent with derived benthic and limnetic fish, which may have predisposed the repeated genetic accommodation of this specific suite of traits. We also found significant shape differences between marine and anadromous stickleback, which has implications for evaluating the ancestral state of stickleback traits. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract = {If an ancestral stem group repeatedly colonizes similar environments, developmental plasticity specific to that group should consistently give rise to similar phenotypes. Parallel selection on those similar phenotypes could lead to the repeated evolution of characteristic ecotypes, a property common to many adaptive radiations. A key prediction of this "flexible stem" model of adaptive radiation is that patterns of phenotypic divergence in derived groups should mirror patterns of developmental plasticity in their common ancestor. The threespine stickleback radiation provides an excellent opportunity to test this prediction because the marine form is representative of the ancestral stem group, which has repeatedly given rise to several characteristic ecotypes. We examined plasticity of several aspects of shape and trophic morphology in response to diets characteristic of either the derived benthic ecotype or the limnetic ecotype. When marine fish were reared on alternative diets, plasticity of head and mouth shape paralleled phenotypic divergence between the derived ecotypes, supporting the flexible stem model. Benthic and limnetic fish exhibited patterns of plasticity similar to those of the marine population; however, some differences in population means were present, as well as subtle differences in shape plasticity in the benthic population, indicating a role for genetic accommodation in this system. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {Trophic cascade studies have so far mostly focused on changes in the abundance, biomass, or average size of prey and predators. In contrast, individual size-based interactions, playing a key role in the trophic structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems, have been less explored. We conducted a 3-month in situ experiment in Lake M{\'{y}}vatn, Iceland, with two fish treatments (with and without fish, Gasterosteus aculeatus). After the first month of the experiment, Anabaena blooms appeared in the lake. We studied the effects of fish predation and occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms on the individual size structure (i.e. the distribution of the number of organisms over a size range) of zooplankton and phytoplankton. We also assessed the potential consequences for trophic transfer efficiency (TTE) (measured as the predator to prey biomass ratio) in the planktonic food web. Our results showed that fish predation and cyanobacteria bloom had a negative relationship with size diversity of zooplankton, which became dominated by small-sized individuals in both cases. The phytoplankton size diversity changed over time particularly due to the blooming of large-sized Anabaena, and its increase was apparently mainly driven by changes in resources. Low zooplankton size diversity related to fish predation reduced TTE, particularly in the enclosures with fish. This may be because low zooplankton size diversity represents a lower partition of resources among consumers, thereby decreasing the trophic energy transfer. With the occurrence of Anabaena bloom, high phytoplankton size diversity coincided with a lower energy transfer in all enclosures likely due to reduced zooplankton grazing when large-sized colony-forming Anabaena dominated. In conclusion, our results indicate that both top-down and bottom-up forces significantly influence the size structure of planktonic communities. The changes in size structure were related to shifts in the energy transfer efficiency of the Lake M{\'{y}}vatn food web. Thus, our study underpins the importance of taking into account size-based interactions in the study of trophic cascades, particularly in a warming climate where strong planktivorous fish predation and frequent cyanobacteria blooms may occur.},

We know little, however, about the combined effects of ecological and evolutionary change on community structure. We simultaneously examined the effects of top-predator ecology and evolution on freshwater community parameters using recently evolved generalist and specialist ecotypes of three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We used a mesocosm experiment to directly examine the effects of ecological (fish presence and density) and evolutionary (phenotypic diversity and specialization) factors on community structure at lower trophic levels. We evaluated zooplankton biomass and composition, periphyton and phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentration, and net primary production among treatments containing different densities and diversities of stickleback. Our results showed that both ecological and evolutionary differences in the top-predator affect different aspects of community structure and composition. Community structure, specifically the abundance of organisms at each trophic level, was affected by stickleback presence and density, whereas composition of zooplankton was influenced by stickleback diversity and specialization. Primary productivity, in terms of chlorophyll-a concentration and net primary production was affected by ecological but not evolutionary factors. Our results stress the importance of concurrently evaluating both changes in density and phenotypic diversity on the structure and composition of communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Des Roches et al.},

While most studies conducted in oligotrophic subarctic lakes show strong top–down control on consumers in the presence of fish, several studies undertaken in eutrophic subarctic Lake M{\'{y}}vatn, Iceland, suggest that it is consumer–resource interactions that drive the whole-lake community. Here, we used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen from the main food web compartments derived from a 3-month in situ-controlled mesocosm experiment involving two treatments (with and without fish) with three replicates each to determine the effects of fish on the trophic structure of the Lake M{\'{y}}vatn food web. We found that the whole food web trophic structure shifted towards the upper part of the water column (more planktonic habitat) in fishless enclosures. Additionally, the trophic niche of organisms occupying the base of the food web became more diversified when fish were absent, and the trophic redundancy of all taxa decreased (more dissimilar trophic niches). Stronger top–down effects may also result from global warming, producing increased abundance of planktivorous fish in subarctic lakes. Our results indicate that this could lead to a shift in trophic niche and reduced trophic diversity of most food web organisms.},

Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) have diverged along the benthic-limnetic axis into allopatric morphotypes in thousands of populations and into sympatric species pairs in several lakes. However, only a few well known populations have been studied because identifying additional populations as either benthic or limnetic requires detailed dietary or observational studies. In the present study, we develop a Fisher's linear discriminant function based on the skull morphology of known benthic and limnetic stickleback populations from the Cook Inlet Basin of Alaska and test the feasibility of using this function to identify other morphologically divergent populations. Benthic and limnetic morphotypes were separable using this technique and, of 45 populations classified, three were identified as morphologically extreme (two benthic and one limnetic), nine as moderately divergent (three benthic and six limnetic), and the remaining 33 populations as morphologically intermediate. Classification scores were found to correlate with eye size, the depth profile of lakes, and the presence of invasive northern pike (Esox lucius). This type of classification function provides a means of integrating the complex morphological differences between morphotypes into a single score that reflects the position of a population along the benthic-limnetic axis and can be used to relate that position to other aspects of stickleback biology. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.},

abstract = {Parasite communities of fishes are known to respond directly to the abiotic environment of the host, for example, to water quality and water temperature. Biotic factors are also important as they affect the exposure profile through heterogeneities in parasite distribution in the environment. Parasites in a particular environment may pose a strong selection on fish. For example, ecological differences in selection by parasites have been hypothesized to facilitate evolutionary differentiation of freshwater fish morphs specializing on different food types. However, as parasites may also respond directly to abiotic environment the parasite risk does not depend only on biotic features of the host environment. It is possible that different morphs experience specific selection gradients by parasites but it is not clear how consistent the selection is when abiotic factors change. We examined parasite pressure in sympatric morphs of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across a temperature gradient in two large Icelandic lakes, Myvatn and Thingvallavatn. Habitat-specific temperature gradients in these lakes are opposite. Myvatn lava rock morph lives in a warm environment, while the mud morph lives in the cold. In Thingvallavatn, the lava rock morph lives in a cold environment and the mud morph in a warm habitat. We found more parasites in fish living in higher temperature in both lakes, independent of the fish morph, and this pattern was similar for the two dominating parasite taxa, trematodes and cestodes. However, at the same time, we also found higher parasite abundance in a third morph living in deep cold-water habitat in Thingvallavatn compared to the cold-water lava morph, indicating strong effect of habitat-specific biotic factors. Our results suggest complex interactions between water temperature and biotic factors in determining the parasite community structure, a pattern that may have implications for differentiation of stickleback morphs. Ecological differences in selection by parasites have recently been hypothesized to facilitate evolutionary differentiation of freshwater fish morphs. However, as parasites may also respond directly to abiotic environment, such as water temperature, it is not clear how consistent these selection gradients are when abiotic factors change. We examined parasite pressure in sympatric morphs of threespine stickleback in two Icelandic lakes with opposing habitat-specific water temperature gradients. We found higher infestation in fish living in higher temperature irrespective of the fish morph, but also a strong effect of host ecology in a morph living in deep cold water habitat.

abstract = {Shallow lakes and their ectothermic inhabitants are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climatic warming. These impacts are likely to depend on nutrient loading, especially if the combination of warming and eutrophication leads to severe hypoxia. To investigate effects of realistic warming and nutrient loading on a fish species with high tolerance of warming and hypoxia, we observed population changes and timing of reproduction of three-spined sticklebacks in 24 outdoor shallow freshwater ecosystems with combinations of temperature (ambient and ambient +4 °C) and three nutrient treatments over 16 months. Warming reduced stickleback population biomass by 60% (population size by 76%) and nutrient-addition reduced biomass by about 80% (population size 95%). Nutrients and warming together resulted in extinction of the stickleback populations. These losses were mainly attributed to the increased likelihood of severe hypoxia in heated and nutrient-addition mesocosms. Warming of nutrient-rich waters can thus have dire consequences for freshwater ectotherm populations. The loss even of a hardy fish suggests a precarious future for many less tolerant species in such eutrophic systems under current climate change predictions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Studying how trophic traits and niche use are related in natural populations is important in order to understand adaptation and specialization. Here, we describe trophic trait diversity in twenty-five Norwegian freshwater threespine stickleback populations and their putative marine ancestor, and relate trait differences to postglacial lake age. By studying lakes of different ages, depths and distance to the sea we examine key environmental variables that may predict adaptation in trophic position and habitat use. We measured trophic traits including geometric landmarks that integrated variation in head shape as well as gillraker length and number. Trophic position (Tpos) and niche use ($\alpha$) were estimated from stable isotopes ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N). A comparison of head shape was also made with two North American benthic-limnetic species pairs. Results: We found that head shape differed between marine and freshwater sticklebacks, with marine sticklebacks having more upturned mouths, smaller eyes, larger opercula and deeper heads. Size-adjusted gillraker lengths were larger in marine than in freshwater stickleback. Norwegian sticklebacks were compared on the same head shape axis as the one differentiating the benthic-limnetic North American threespine stickleback species pairs. Here, Norwegian freshwater sticklebacks with a more "limnetic head shape" had more and longer gillrakers than sticklebacks with "benthic head shape". The "limnetic morph" was positively associated with deeper lakes. Populations differed in $\alpha$ (mean ± sd: 0.76 ± 0.29) and Tpos (3.47 ± 0.27), where $\alpha$ increased with gillraker length. Larger fish had a higher Tpos than smaller fish. Compared to the ecologically divergent stickleback species pairs and solitary lake populations in North America, Norwegian freshwater sticklebacks had similar range in Tpos and $\alpha$ values, but much less trait divergences. Conclusions: Our results showed trait divergences between threespine stickleback in marine and freshwater environments. Freshwater populations diverged in trophic ecology and trophic traits, but trophic ecology was not related to the elapsed time in freshwater. Norwegian sticklebacks used the same niches as the ecologically divergent North American stickleback species pairs. However, as trophic trait divergences were smaller, and not strongly associated with the ecological niche, ecological adaptations along the benthic-limnetic axis were less developed in Norwegian sticklebacks.},

abstract = {The study of local adaptation is rendered difficult by many evolutionary confounding phenomena (for example, genetic drift and demographic history). When complex traits are involved in local adaptation, phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity further hamper evolutionary biologists to study the complex relationships between phenotype, genotype and environment. In this perspective paper, we suggest that the common garden experiment, specifically designed to deal with phenotypic plasticity, has a clear role to play in the study of local adaptation, even (if not specifically) in the genomic era. After a quick review of some high-throughput genotyping protocols relevant in the context of a common garden, we explore how to improve common garden analyses with dense marker panel data and recent statistical methods. We then show how combining approaches from population genomics and genome-wide association studies with the settings of a common garden can yield to a very efficient, thorough and integrative study of local adaptation. Especially, evidence from genomic (for example, genome scan) and phenotypic origins constitute independent insights into the possibility of local adaptation scenarios, and genome-wide association studies in the context of a common garden experiment allow to decipher the genetic bases of adaptive traits.},

abstract = {Phenotypic expression can be altered by direct perception of environmental cues (within-generation phenotypic plasticity) and by the environmental cues experienced by previous generations (transgenerational plasticity). Few studies, however, have investigated how the characteristics of phenotypic traits affect their propensity to exhibit plasticity within and across generations. We tested whether plasticity differed within and across generations between morphological and behavioral anti-predator traits of Physa acuta, a freshwater snail. We reared 18 maternal lineages of P. acuta snails over two generations using a full factorial design of exposure to predator or control cues and quantified adult F2 shell size, shape, crush resistance, and anti-predator behavior – all traits which potentially affect their ability to avoid or survive predation attempts. We found that most morphological traits exhibited transgenerational plasticity, with parental exposure to predator cues resulting in larger and more crush-resistant offspring, but shell shape demonstrated within-generation plasticity. In contrast, we found that anti-predator behavior expressed only within-generation plasticity such that offspring reared in predator cues responded less to the threat of predation than control offspring. We discuss the consequences of this variation in plasticity for trait evolution and ecological dynamics. Overall, our study suggests that further empirical and theoretical investigation is needed in what types of traits are more likely to be affected by within-generational and transgenerational plasticity.},

abstract = {Human-induced processes like eutrophication are increasing water turbidity and altering vegetated habitats in the Baltic Sea. Unfortunately, the influence of these environmental changes on predator–prey interactions remains poorly studied in mobile taxa of this region. We used three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) as a model species to study the combined effects of turbidity and shoot density on habitat choice (shelter vs. open) in the presence and absence of piscivorous perch (Perca fluviatilis). Habitat choice of sticklebacks was video-monitored and compared between two paired observation periods: “control” (no predator) and “risk” (predator present). Though sticklebacks exhibited a general preference for sheltered habitat across treatments, repeated measures ANOVA found that sticklebacks responded to predator presence by significantly increasing use of the sheltered habitat. However, shoot density of the shelter interacted with observation period, where risk-induced shifts of sticklebacks into sheltered habitat were most apparent and sustained at higher shoot densities. Stickleback activity level was generally reduced with predator presence at higher turbidity and shoot density levels, suggesting a possible adaptation to reduce predator encounter rates in visually deteriorated conditions. Overall, our study demonstrates that relatively minute increases (1's – 10's of NTU) in algal turbidity intensify three-spined stickleback sheltered habitat use, but vegetation density may still play a larger role in avoiding predators at these turbidity levels. When compared with a similar study on 0+ perch, our work suggests that eutrophication (i.e., increased turbidity, loss of habitat complexity) may have variable, taxon- and/or habitat-specific effects on predator–prey interactions of the Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Population divergence in antipredator defence and behaviour occurs rapidly and repeatedly. Genetic differences, phenotypic plasticity or parental effects may all contribute to divergence, but the relative importance of each of these mechanisms remains unknown. We exposed juveniles to parents and predators to measure how induced changes contribute to shoaling behaviour differences between two threespine stickleback species (benthics and limnetics: Gasterosteus spp). We found that limnetics increased shoaling in response to predator attacks, whereas benthics did not alter their behaviour. Care by limnetic fathers led to increased shoaling in both limnetic and benthic offspring. Shoaling helps limnetics avoid trout and avian predation; our results suggest that this adaptive behaviour is the result of a combination of paternal effects, predator-induced plasticity and genetic differences between species. These results suggest that plasticity substantially contributes to the rapid divergence in shoaling behaviour across the post-Pleistocene radiation of sticklebacks. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Identifying traits that underlie variation in individual performance of consumers (i.e., trait utility) can help reveal the ecological causes of population divergence and the subsequent consequences for species interactions and community structure. Here, we document a case of rapid divergence (over the past 100 generations, or ∼150 years) in foraging traits and feeding efficiency between a lake and stream population pair of threespine stickleback. Building on predictions from functional trait models of fish feeding, we analyzed foraging experiments with a Bayesian path analysis and elucidated the traits explaining variation in foraging performance and the species composition of ingested prey. Despite extensive previous research on the divergence of foraging traits among populations and ecotypes of stickleback, our results provide novel experimental evidence of trait utility for jaw protrusion, gill raker length, and gill raker spacing when foraging on a natural zooplankton assemblage. Furthermore, we discuss how these traits might contribute to the differential effects of lake and stream stickleback on their prey communities, observed in both laboratory and mesocosm conditions. More generally, our results illustrate how the rapid divergence of functional foraging traits of consumers can impact the biomass, species composition, and trophic structure of prey communities.

abstract = {Nongenetic inheritance mechanisms such as transgenerational plasticity (TGP) can buffer populations against rapid environmental change such as ocean warming. Yet, little is known about how long these effects persist and whether they are cumulative over generations. Here, we tested for adaptive TGP in response to simulated ocean warming across parental and grandparental generations of marine sticklebacks. Grandparents were acclimated for two months during reproductive conditioning, whereas parents experienced developmental acclimation, allowing us to compare the fitness consequences of short-term vs. prolonged exposure to elevated temperature across multiple generations. We found that reproductive output of F1 adults was primarily determined by maternal developmental temperature, but carry-over effects from grandparental acclimation environments resulted in cumulative negative effects of elevated temperature on hatching success. In very early stages of growth, F2 offspring reached larger sizes in their respective paternal and grandparental environment down the paternal line, suggesting that other factors than just the paternal genome may be transferred between generations. In later growth stages, maternal and maternal granddam environments strongly influenced offspring body size, but in opposing directions, indicating that the mechanism(s) underlying the transfer of environmental information may have differed between acute and developmental acclimation experienced by the two generations. Taken together, our results suggest that the fitness consequences of parental and grandparental TGP are highly context dependent, but will play an important role in mediating some of the impacts of rapid climate change in this system.},

abstract = {This field-based study examined a suite of morphological traits expressed by brook sticklebacks (Culaea inconstans (Kirtland, 1840)) coexisting with two types of predator communities. "Small-predator" communities included gape-limited predators only; "mixed-predator" communities included both gape-limited and non-gape-limited predators. Across 26 study sites in three drainages, sticklebacks in small-predator communities had longer bodies, longer spines, and deeper midbodies than those in mixed-predator communities. The observed differences were consistent with the hypothesis that stickleback morphology in small-predator communities would be better adapted for avoiding gape-limited predators and that in mixed-predator communities should be better adapted for avoiding large, non-gape-limited predators. Morphological differences were apparent in 1-year-old sticklebacks and likely resulted from predator-prey interactions early in the sticklebacks' life history. Correlation among morphological traits involved in antipredator defense (i.e., morphological integration) was hypothesized to occur in small-predator communities, characterized by a single gape-limited predation pressure, but not mixed-predator communities where sticklebacks coexisted with multiple predator types in each site. Contrary to expectations, length-at-age, spine length, and body depth were not correlated in either predator community. Numerous variables, not present in controlled laboratory studies, may constrain morphological expression in the field environment. {\textcopyright} 2007 NRC.},

abstract = {In marine climate change research, salinity shifts have been widely overlooked. While widespread desalination effects are expected in higher latitudes, salinity is predicted to increase closer to the equator. We took advantage of the steep salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea as a space-for-time design to address effects of salinity change on populations. Additionally, genetic diversity, a prerequisite for adaptive responses, is reduced in Baltic compared to Atlantic populations. On the one hand, adaptive transgenerational plasticity (TGP) might buffer the effects of environmental change, which may be of particular importance under reduced genetic variation. On the other hand, physiological trade-offs due to environmental stress may hamper parental provisioning to offspring thereby intensifying the impact of climate change across generations (nonadaptive TGP). Here, we studied both hypothesis of adaptive and nonadaptive TGP in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) fish model along the strong salinity gradient of the Baltic Sea in a space-for-time experiment. Each population tolerated desalination well, which was not altered by parental exposure to low salinity. Despite a common marine ancestor, populations locally adapted to low salinity lost their ability to cope with fully marine conditions, resulting in lower survival and reduced relative fitness. Negative transgenerational effects were evident in early life stages, but disappeared after selection via mortality occurred during the first 12–30 days posthatch. Modeling various strengths of selection, we showed that nonadaptive transgenerational plasticity accelerated evolution by increasing directional selection within the offspring generation. Qualitatively, when genetic diversity is large, we predict that such effects will facilitate rapid adaptation and population persistence, while below a certain threshold populations suffer a higher risk of local extinction. Overall, our results suggest that transgenerational plasticity and selection are not independent of each other and thereby highlight a current gap in TGP studies.},

abstract = {It is a fundamental feature of evolution that natural selection acts on individuals to adapt to predation pressure via the development of anti-predator mechanisms. As such mechanisms are costly in terms of energy and time, species living in habitats where predators are rare or absent were expected to show reduced predator responses. Such a reduction was expected for larvae of the native whitefish (Coregonus wartmanni) in Upper Lake Constance, as these pass their initial stage in a historically predator-free pelagic habitat and only start to encounter predators in a later ontogenetic stage during which they shift to littoral habitat. However, a recent invader of the pelagic waters of the lake, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), is implicated in a severe decline in whitefish recruitment through larval predation. The predator-naivety effect and its consequences on predation were experimentally tested by comparing predator defenses of different age classes of whitefish with those of roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluviatilis), two species whose larvae grow up in a predator-holding habitat. As predator, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was selected. Sticklebacks actively hunted all prey species but predation was high on whitefish only. The addition of zooplankton (Daphnia) as alternative prey for sticklebacks in the experimental setup did not reduce predation on the whitefish larvae, indicating a clear preference for whitefish in this invasive predator. The escape responses of roach and perch were found to be clearly more complex and diverse to those of the predator-na{\"{i}}ve whitefish larvae. Particularly striking was that whitefish often did not show any apparent behavioral response to the approaching predator. Only large whitefish larvae (Table 1: length = 40.8 ± 0.6 mm) appeared capable of escaping predation, and this was correlated with a change in complexity of predator escape responses. Thus, differences in predation pressure for the different larvae species were highly related to the observed interspecific differences in predator defenses, and with the ontogenetic intraspecific change in whitefish from poor and inefficient predator escape responses to complex and more efficient predator escape responses. The evolutionary consequences of stickleback as an invasive predator on whitefish larvae behavior are discussed.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity can influence evolutionary change in a lineage, ranging from facilitation of population persistence in a novel environment to directing the patterns of evolutionary change. As the specific nature of plasticity can impact evolutionary consequences, it is essential to consider how plasticity is manifested if we are to understand the contribution of plasticity to phenotypic evolution. Most morphological traits are developmentally plastic, irreversible, and generally considered to be costly, at least when the resultant phenotype is mis-matched to the environment. At the other extreme, behavioral phenotypes are typically activational (modifiable on very short time scales), and not immediately costly as they are produced by constitutive neural networks. Although patterns of morphological and behavioral plasticity are often compared, patterns of plasticity of life history phenotypes are rarely considered. Here we review patterns of plasticity in these trait categories within and among populations, comprising the adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish Gasterosteus aculeatus. We immediately found it necessary to consider the possibility of iterated development, the concept that behavioral and life history trajectories can be repeatedly reset on activational (usually behavior) or developmental (usually life history) time frames, offering fine tuning of the response to environmental context. Morphology in stickleback is primarily reset only in that developmental trajectories can be altered as environments change over the course of development. As anticipated, the boundaries between the trait categories are not clear and are likely to be linked by shared, underlying physiological and genetic systems.},

Alternatively, niche variation might be a side-effect of neutral genomic diversity in larger populations. We tested these alternatives in a metapopulation of threespine stickleback. Stickleback consume benthic and limnetic invertebrates, focusing on the former in small lakes, the latter in large lakes. Intermediate-sized lakes support generalist stickleback populations using an even mixture of the two prey types, and exhibit greater among-individual variation in diet and morphology. In contrast, genomic diversity increases with lake size. Thus, phenotypic diversity and neutral genetic polymorphism are decoupled: trophic diversity being greatest in intermediate-sized lakes with high resource diversity, whereas neutral genetic diversity is greatest in the largest lakes.},

Phenotypic plasticity can increase the frequency of extreme phenotypes in a population and thus allow it to make use of a wide resource spectrum.

In a commongarden experiment, we show that solitary, generalist populations of threespine sticklebacks inhabiting small coastal lakes of British Columbia have a higher degree of morphological plasticity than the more specialized sympatric limnetic and benthic species. The ancestral marine stickleback showed low levels of plasticity similar to those of sympatric sticklebacks, implying that the greater plasticity of the generalist population has evolved recently. Measurements of wild populations show that those with mean trait values intermediate between the benthic and limnetic values indeed have higher morphological variation.

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary responses of natural populations to spatial environmental variation strongly depend on the relative strength of environmental differences/natural selection and dispersal/gene flow. In absence of geographic barriers, as often is the case in lake ecosystems, gene flow is expected to constrain adaptive divergence between environments - favoring phenotypic plasticity or high trait variability. However, if divergent natural selection is sufficiently strong, adaptive divergence can occur in face of gene flow. The extent of divergence is most often studied between two contrasting environments, whereas potential for multimodal divergence is little explored. We investigated phenotypic (body size, defensive structures, and feeding morphology) and genetic (microsatellites) structure in threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across five habitat types and two basins (North and South) within the geologically young and highly heterogeneous Lake Myvatn, North East Iceland. We found that (1) North basin stickleback were, on average, larger and had relatively longer spines than South basin stickleback, whereas (2) feeding morphology (gill raker number and gill raker gap width) differed among three of five habitat types, and (3) there was only subtle genetic differentiation across the lake. Overall, our results indicate predator and prey mediated phenotypic divergence across multiple habitats in the lake, in face of gene flow. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {A venerable view of speciation is that reproductive isolation ultimately evolves from contrasting selection pressures between populations exploiting different resource environments. Yet, this 'ecological' mode of species origins has been tested rarely in nature. Here I describe emerging evidence if divergent selection and speciation in fishes of postglacial lakes. Examples of very closely related species within such lakes are known from over a dozen independent fish lineages. These pairs display four remarkable attributes which together raise the possibility of ecological speciation: rapid evolution of assortative mating in sympatry and/or allopatry; persistence in sympatry despite a history of gene flow; a high degree of niche differentiation (usually one species is planktivorous and the other is benthic) accompanied by differences in body size and shape; and high intrinsic viability and fertility of interspecific hybrids. More direct evidence for ecological speciation comes from preliminary confirmation of three predictions: selection against hybrids has an ecological basis (morphologically intermediate hybrid sticklebacks have a reduced ability to exploit the main resources on which the parent species are specialized); premating isolation is linked to the morphological traits that have diverged between species (hybridization in sticklebacks occurs only between the morphologically most similar individuals of the two parent species); premating isolation mechanism evolve in parallel in similar environments (interspecific mate preferences appear to have diverge in parallel in stickleback species pairs that evolved indepedently). These findings argue that knowledge of ecological environments is essential to understanding the origin of species in adaptive radiation, perhaps more generally. Field studies of selection on traits determining reproductive isolation are solely needed, and would complement (and perhaps transform) traditional genetic approaches to speciation.},

abstract = {A number of recent articles have investigated the potential of familiarity preferences to influence group membership in free-ranging animals. However, it is not clear to which extent individual recognition or a more general recognition of a group odor is responsible for familiarity preferences. First, we tested the sensory basis of the recognition of familiars in stickleback. When allowed to choose between a familiar and a nonfamiliar stimulus shoal on the basis of both visual and chemical communication, visual communication only, and chemical communication only, the preference of focal fish for familiars was shown to depend on the presence of chemical cues. We subsequently investigated the effects of recent habitat and diet on shoaling preferences in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Experimental fish were divided into four treatment groups consisting of two water treatments (saline and freshwater) and two diet treatments (Daphnia spp. and bloodworm). Focal fish subsequently showed significant association preferences for groups of nonfamiliar fish that had undergone the same water or diet treatment as themselves. These data indicate that individual recognition is not a prerequisite for the expression of association preferences.},

However, the independent evolution of single traits cannot explain how observed phenotypic variations of these traits are maintained within populations. We studied genetic and phenotypic correlations between antipredator behaviors (shoaling and risk-taking) and morphology traits (pigmentation and size) in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks by using pedigree-based quantitative genetic analysis to test phenotypic integration (or complex phenotype) as an evolutionary response to predation risk. Individuals with strongly melanized (i.e., camouflaged) phenotype and genotype were less sociable to conspecifics, but bolder during foraging under predation risk. Individuals with faster growing phenotype and genotype were bolder, and those with lager eyes were more fearful. These phenotypic integrations were not confounded with correlated plastic responses to predation risk because the phenotypes were measured in na{\"{i}}ve fish born in the laboratory, but originated from a natural population with predation pressure. Consistent selection for particular combinations of traits under predation pressure or pleiotropic genes might influence the maintenance of the genetic (co)variations and polymorphism in melanin color, growth trajectory, and behavior patterns.},

abstract = {Phenotypic plasticity, both within and across generations, is an important mechanism that organisms use to cope with rapid climate change. While an increasing number of studies show that plasticity across generations (transgenerational plasticity or TGP) may occur, we have limited understanding of key aspects of TGP, such as the environmental conditions that may promote it, its relationship to within-generation plasticity (WGP) and its role in evolutionary potential. In this review, we consider how the detection of TGP in climate change experiments is affected by the predictability of environmental variation, as well as the timing and magnitude of environmental change cues applied. We also discuss the need to design experiments that are able to distinguish TGP from selection and TGP from WGP in multigenerational experiments. We conclude by suggesting future research directions that build on the knowledge to date and admit the limitations that exist, which will depend on the way environmental change is simulated and the type of experimental design used. Such an approach will open up this burgeoning area of research to a wider variety of organisms and allow better predictive capacity of the role of TGP in the response of organisms to future climate change.},

Despite enormous potential importance-particularly in an era of rapid climate change-TGP in thermal growth physiology has never been demonstrated for vertebrates. We provide the first evidence for thermal TGP in a vertebrate: given sufficient time, sheepshead minnows adaptively program their offspring for maximal growth at the present temperature. The change in growth over a single generation (c. 30%) exceeds the single-generation rate of adaptive evolution by an order of magnitude.

abstract = {Many organisms exhibit phenotypic plasticity; producing alternate phenotypes depending on the environment. Individuals can be plastic (intragenerational or direct plasticity), wherein individuals of the same genotype produce different phenotypes in response to the environments they experience. Alternatively, an individual's phenotype may be under the control of its parents, usually the mother (transgenerational or indirect plasticity), so that mother's genotype determines the phenotype produced by a given genotype of her offspring. Under what conditions does plasticity evolve to have intragenerational as opposed to transgenerational genetic control? To explore this question, we present a population genetic model for the evolution of transgenerational and intragenerational plasticity. We hypothesize that the capacity for plasticity incurs a fitness cost, which is borne either by the individual developing the plastic phenotype or by its mother. We also hypothesize that individuals are imperfect predictors of future environments and their capacity for plasticity can lead them occasionally to make a low-fitness phenotype for a particular environment. When the cost, benefit and error parameters are equal, we show that there is no evolutionary advantage to intragenerational over transgenerational plasticity, although the rate of evolution of transgenerational plasticity is half the rate for intragenerational plasticity, as predicted by theory on indirect genetic effects. We find that transgenerational plasticity evolves when mothers are better predictors of future environments than offspring or when the fitness cost of the capacity for plasticity is more readily borne by a mother than by her developing offspring. We discuss different natural systems with either direct intragenerational plasticity or indirect transgenerational plasticity and find a pattern qualitatively in accord with the predictions of our model.},

Females benefit from choosing such individuals if quality is heritable. A key prediction is that the offspring of males with elaborate mating displays will perform better than those of less elaborate males, but it has proved difficult to demonstrate such an effect independently of the effects of differences in parental investment. We tested for 'good genes' linked to male ornamentation in the three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus using in vitro fertilization to generate maternal half-siblings, which were raised without parental care. Maternal half-siblings sired by brightly coloured males grew less quickly than half-siblings sired by dull males but were more resistant to a controlled disease challenge. Among the offspring that became infected, those with brighter fathers had higher white blood cell counts. This suggests that highly ornamented males confer disease resistance on their offspring. The association with reduced growth suggests a mechanism for the maintenance of heritable variation in both disease resistance and male sexual coloraton.},

abstract = {Theoretical models predict that nonlinear environmental effects on the phenotype also affect developmental canalization, which in turn can influence the tempo and course of organismal evolution. Here, we used an oceanic population of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) to investigate temperature-induced phenotypic plasticity of body size and shape using a paternal half-sibling, split-clutch experimental design and rearing offspring under three different temperature regimes (13, 17 and 21 °C). Body size and shape of 466 stickleback individuals were assessed by a set of 53 landmarks and analysed using geometric morphometric methods. At approximately 100 days, individuals differed significantly in both size and shape across the temperature groups. However, the temperature-induced differences between 13 and 17 °C (mainly comprising relative head and eye size) deviated considerably from those between 17 and 21 °C (involving the relative size of the ectocoracoid, the operculum and the ventral process of the pelvic girdle). Body size was largest at 17 °C. For both size and shape, phenotypic variance was significantly smaller at 17 °C than at 13 and 21 °C, indicating that development is most stable at the intermediate temperature matching the conditions encountered in the wild. Higher additive genetic variance at 13 and 21 °C indicates that the plastic response to temperature had a heritable basis. Understanding nonlinear effects of temperature on development and the underlying genetics are important for modelling evolution and for predicting outcomes of global warming, which can lead not only to shifts in average morphology but also to destabilization of development. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

Male three-spined stickleback are the sole providers of parental care that is necessary for offspring survival; therefore, this system offers the opportunity to study the inheritance of parental behaviour when selection is primarily acting on males. Fanning behaviour is a conspicuous parental behaviour that is readily quantified in this species. We show that the heritability of fanning behaviour is ≥0.9 and significantly different from zero within a freshwater population. Moreover, there was abundant genetic variation for fanning behaviour, indicating that it could readily evolve. These results suggest that parenting behaviour is tractable for further genetic dissection in this system..},

Fathers altered their paternal behaviour when exposed to predation risk, and consequently produced adult offspring with phenotypes associated with strong predation pressure (smaller size, reduced body condition, reduced behavioural activity). Moreover, more attentive fathers produced offspring that showed stronger antipredator responses. These results are consistent with behaviourally mediated paternal programming: fathers can alter offspring phenotypes to match their future environment and influence offspring traits well into adulthood. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

For example, female sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce eggs with higher concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, and offspring with altered behavior and physiology. Male sticklebacks exposed to predation risk produce offspring that are less active, smaller, and in poorer condition. The precise mechanisms by which maternal and paternal experiences with predators affect offspring phenotypes are under investigation, and could include steroid hormones, olfactory cues and/or parental behavior. As in other species, some of the consequences of parental exposure to predation risk for offspring in sticklebacks might be adaptive, but depend on the stressor, the reliability of the parental and offspring environments and the evolutionary history of the population.},

Using quantitative genetics, here we demonstrate that parental effects substantially contribute to the evolutionary potential of larval antipredator responses in a leaf beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata). Previous research showed that larger L. decemlineata larvae elicit stronger antipredator responses, and mothers perceiving predators improved offspring responses by increasing intraclutch cannibal-ism—an extreme form of offspring provisioning. We now report substantial additive genetic variation underlying maternal ability to induce intraclutch cannibalism, indicating the potential of this adaptive maternal effect to evolve by natural selection. We also show that paternal size, a heritable trait, affected larval responses to predation risk but that larval responses themselves had little additive genetic variation. Together, these results demonstrate how larval responses to predation risk can evolve via two types of parental effects, both of which provide indirect sources of genetic variation for offspring traits.},

We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5.

abstract = {Maternal effects are influences of maternal attributes on the offspring phenotype where the causality of the effects is not via direct genetic transmission of maternal alleles. First considered to be a nuisance parameter by animal and plant breeders, maternal effects are now increasingly perceived to be an integral part of the evolutionary process. Here we provide an overview of the quantitative genetic theory and empirical findings responsible for this altered perspective and highlight directions for future research.},
